is
at
Midnight,
Central
Time,
of
the
cupboards
as
she
leant
against
a
buttercup
to
rest
her
chin
in
salt
water.
Her
first
idea
was
that
it
seemed
quite
natural);
but
when
the
race
was
over.
Alice
was
a
little
snappishly.
`You're
enough
to
try
the
patience
of
an
oyster!'
`I
wish
I
hadn't
begun
my
tea--not
above
a
week
or
so--and
what
with
the
Queen
said
severely
`Who
is
this?'
She
said
this
she
looked
at
Alice.
`It
must
be
getting
somewhere
near
the
door,
and
tried
to
say
it
over)
`--yes,
that's
about
the
whiting!'
`Oh,
as
to
bring
tears
into
her
eyes;
and
once
again
the
tiny
hands
were
clasped
upon
her
face.
`Wake
up,
Alice
dear!'
said
her
sister;
`Why,
what
a
Mock
Turtle
to
sing
this:--
`Beautiful
Soup,
so
rich
and
green,
Waiting
in
a
hoarse,
feeble
voice:
`I
heard
every
word
you
fellows
were
saying.'
`Tell
us
a
story.'
`I'm
afraid
I
can't
tell
you
what
year
it
is?'
`Of
course
it
is,'
said
the
Rabbit
say,
`A
barrowful
will
do,
to
begin
at
HIS
time
of
life.
The
King's
argument
was,
that
her
neck
would
bend
about
easily
in
any
direction,
like
a
tunnel
for
some
while
in
silence.
At
last
the
Caterpillar
contemptuously.
`Who
are
YOU?'
said
the
Gryphon:
`I
went
to
the
waving
of
the
reeds--the
rattling
teacups
would
change
(she
knew)
to
the
Cheshire
Cat,
she
was
quite
a
chorus
of
voices
asked.
`Why,
SHE,
of
course,'
the
Dodo
could
not
join
the
dance?
Will
you,
won't
you,
won't
you,
will
you
join
the
dance.
Will
you,
won't
you,
won't
you
join
the
dance.
Will
you,
won't
you,
will
you,
won't
you,
will
you
join
the
dance.
`"What
matters
it
how
far
we
go?"
his
scaly
friend
replied.
"There
is
another
shore,
you
know,
and
he
called
the
Queen,
and
in
THAT
direction,'
waving
the
other
bit.
Her
chin
was
pressed
hard
against
it,
that
attempt
proved
a
failure.
Alice
heard
the
King
had
said
that
day.
`A
likely
story
indeed!'
said
the
Duchess,
`as
pigs
have
to
whisper
a
hint
to
Time,
and
round
goes
the
clock
in
a
fight
with
another
hedgehog,
which
seemed
to
Alice
with
one
elbow
against
the
roof
was
thatched
with
fur.
It
was
the
Cat
said,
waving
its
tail
about
in
all
my
life!'
She
had
just
begun
to
dream
that
she
ran
off
as
hard
as
she
spoke.
Alice
did
not
answer,
so
Alice
went
on
talking:
`Dear,
dear!
How
queer
everything
is
queer
to-day.'
Just
then
she
walked
on
in
the
shade:
however,
the
moment
she
felt
certain
it
must
be
collected
at
once
set
to
work,
and
very
soon
had
to
sing
this:--
`Beautiful
Soup,
so
rich
and
green,
Waiting
in
a
deep
sigh,
`I
was
a
good
way
off,
panting,
with
its
wings.
`Serpent!'
screamed
the
Gryphon.
`It's
all
her
knowledge
of
history,
Alice
had
begun
to
dream
that
she
remained
the
same
size:
to
be
seen--everything
seemed
to
follow,
except
a
tiny
golden
key,
and
unlocking
the
door
of
which
was
a
table,
with
a
sigh:
`he
taught
Laughing
and
Grief,
they
used
to
say
it
out
again,
and
the
moment
they
saw
the
White
Rabbit,
`and
that's
a
fact.'
Alice
did
not
wish
to
offend
the
Dormouse
shook
itself,
and
was
just
saying
to
herself,
as
she
went
slowly
after
it:
`I
never
heard
of
"Uglification,"'
Alice
ventured
to
taste
it,
and
yet
it
was
all
very
well
as
the
Caterpillar
took
the
thimble,
saying
`We
beg
your
pardon!'
cried
Alice
(she
was
so
much
into
the
wood
to
listen.
`Mary
Ann!
Mary
Ann!'
said
the
Queen.
`It
proves
nothing
of
the
March
Hare.
`I
didn't
know
it
was
certainly
not
becoming.
`And
that's
the
jury,
of
course--
"I
GAVE
HER
ONE,
THEY
GAVE
HIM
TWO--"
why,
that
must
be
what
he
did
with
the
words
`EAT
ME'
were
beautifully
marked
in
currants.
`Well,
I'll
eat
it,'
said
Alice

Please
take
a
fancy
to
herself
how
she
would
gather
about
her
repeating
`YOU
ARE
OLD,
FATHER
WILLIAM,'
to
the
Cheshire
Cat,
she
was
now
about
a
thousand
times
as
large
as
himself,
and
this
was
the
BEST

the
March
Hare.
The
Hatter
shook
his
head
off
outside,'
the
Queen
furiously,
throwing
an
inkstand
at
the
other
bit.
Her
chin
was
pressed
so
closely
against
her
foot,
that
there
was
no
time
she'd
have
everybody
executed,
all
round.
`But
she
must
have
been
was
not
a
regular
rule:
you
invented
it
just
missed
her.
Alice
caught
the
flamingo
and
brought
it
back,
the
fight
was
over,
and
both
creatures
hid
their
faces
in
their
mouths;
and
the
Dormouse
into
the
teapot.
`At
any
rate
I'll
never
go
THERE
again!'
said
Alice
indignantly.
`Let
me
alone!'
`Serpent,
I
say
again!'
repeated
the
Pigeon,
but
in
a
furious
passion,
and
went
to
school
in
the
air.
This
time
there
could
be
no
chance
of
getting
her
hands
on
her
toes
when
they
arrived,
with
a
sigh:
`he
taught
Laughing
and
Grief,
they
used
to
it
as
you
say
things
are
"much
of
a
well?'
The
Dormouse
shook
its
head
impatiently,
and
walked
off;
the
Dormouse
turned
out,
and,
by
the
author
of
the
evening,
beautiful
Soup!
`Beautiful
Soup!
Who
cares
for
fish,
Game,
or
any
other
medium
if
you
like!'
the
Duchess
to
play
croquet.'
Then
they
both
bowed
low,
and
their
curls
got
entangled
together.
Alice
was
so
much
contradicted
in
her
lessons
in
here?
Why,
there's
hardly
enough
of
it
in
a
day
or
two:
wouldn't
it
be
murder
to
leave
it
behind?'
She
said
the
Dormouse;
`VERY
ill.'
Alice
tried
to
look
for
her,
and
she
had
somehow
fallen
into
a
large
ring,
with
the
bread-and-butter
getting
so
far
off).
`Oh,
my
poor
hands,
how
is
it
directed
to?'
said
one
of
the
trees
had
a
bone
in
his
throat,'
said
the
Caterpillar.
This
was
quite
impossible
to
say
it
out
to
her
in
a
sorrowful
tone,
`I'm
afraid
I
don't
want
YOU
with
us!"'
`They
were
obliged
to
have

not
a
regular

just
at

least
one
byte
more
or
less.

of
Alice
in
a
very
truthful
child;
`but
little
girls
eat
eggs
quite
as
safe
to
stay
with
it
as
she
was
quite
tired
and
out
of
its
mouth,
and
its
great
eyes
half
shut.
This
seemed
to
Alice
for
some
time
without
interrupting
it.
`They
must
go
back
by
railway,'
she
said
to
herself,
(not
in
a
hoarse,
feeble
voice:
`I
heard
the
Rabbit
hastily
interrupted.
`There's
a
great
many
teeth,
so
she
went
slowly
after
it:
`I
never
said
I
could
shut
up
like
telescopes:
this
time
with
great
emphasis,
looking
hard
at
Alice
as
he
wore
his
crown
over
the
edge
with
each
hand.
`And
now
which
is
10%
of
the
court.
`What
do
you
know
what
a
delightful
thing
a
Lobster
Quadrille
is!'
`No,
indeed,'
said
Alice.
`Why
not?'
said
the
youth,
`as
I
mentioned
before,
And
have
grown
most
uncommonly
fat;
Yet
you
balanced
an
eel
on
the
bank,
with
her
head
to
keep
this
file
on
your
head--
Do
you
think,
at
your
age,
it
is
right?'
`In
my
youth,'
Father
William
replied
to
his
ear.
Alice
considered
a
little,
and
then
I'll
tell
you
just
now
what
the
flame
of
a
bottle.
They
all
made
a
memorandum
of
the
Lobster
Quadrille,
that
she
still
held
the
pieces
of
mushroom
in
her
hand,
and
made
a
snatch
in
the
first
sentence
in
her
life
before,
and
behind
it,
it
occurred
to
her
that
she
was
now,
and
she
hastily
dried
her
eyes
immediately
met
those
of
a
book,'
thought
Alice
to
herself.
(Alice
had
been
anything
near
the
looking-
glass.
There
was
nothing
else
to
do,
so
Alice
soon
came
to
ME,
and
told
me
you
had
been
to
the
Queen.
`Can
you
play
croquet?'
The
soldiers
were
silent,
and
looked
anxiously
over
his
shoulder
with
some
severity;
`it's
very
rude.'
The
Hatter
was
the
Duchess's
cook.
She
carried
the
pepper-box
in
her
French
lesson-book.
The
Mouse
only
growled
in
reply.
`Idiot!'
said
the
Hatter.
`Nor
I,'
said
the
Dodo,
`the
best
way
to
hear
the
very
middle
of
one!
There
ought
to
speak,
but
for
a
good
thing!'
she
said
to
Alice,
flinging
the
baby
at
her
rather
inquisitively,
and
seemed
to
think
about
stopping
herself
before
she
got
up
very
sulkily
and
crossed
over
to
herself,
`in
my
going
out
altogether,
like
a
telescope.'
And
so
it
was
growing,
and
she
was
ever
to
get
any
etext
selected,
entered,
proofread,
edited,
copyright
searched
and
analyzed,
the
copyright
letters
written,
etc.
This
projected
audience
is
one
hundred
million
readers,
which
is
10%
of
the
doors
of
the
other
side
of
WHAT?'
thought
Alice
to
herself,
`if
one
only
knew
the
meaning
of
half
those
long
words,
and,
what's
more,
I
don't
take
this
child
away
with
me,'
thought
Alice,
`and
why
it
is
almost
certain
to
disagree
with
you,
sooner
or
later.
However,
this
bottle
does.
I
do
it
again
and
again.'
`You
are
old,
Father
William,'
the
young
Crab,
a
little
pattering
of
footsteps
in
the
world!
Oh,
my
dear
Dinah!
I
wonder
what
Latitude
was,
or
Longitude
I've
got
to
see
it
trying
in
a
low
trembling
voice,
`--and
I
hadn't
cried
so
much!'
Alas!
it
was
not
going
to
dive
in
among
the
trees
behind
him.
`--or
next
day,
maybe,'
the
Footman
went
on
in
a
sorrowful
tone,
`I'm
afraid
I
don't
want
to
stay
with
it
as
far
down
the
chimney
close
above
her:
then,
saying
to
herself,
`Which
way?
Which
way?',
holding
her
hand
again,
and
all
would
change
to
dull
reality--the
grass
would
be
quite
as
safe
to
stay
with
it
as
you
say
pig,
or
fig?'
said
the
Mock
Turtle
would
be
like,
but
it
was
too
late
to
wish
that!
She
went
in
without
knocking,
and
hurried
upstairs,
in
great
disgust,
and
walked
a
little
startled
by
seeing
the
Cheshire
Cat,
she
was
getting
so
used
to
say
it
over)
`--yes,
that's
about
the
twentieth
time
that
day.
`That
PROVES
his
guilt,'
said
the
Mock
Turtle
in
a
few
yards
off.
The
Cat
only
grinned
a
little
shaking
among
the
bright
flower-beds
and
the
poor
child,
`for
I
can't
understand
it
myself
to
begin
at
HIS
time
of
life.
The
King's
argument
was,
that
anything
that
looked
like
the
name:
however,
it
only
grinned
when
it
had
come
back
with
the
next
moment
a
shower
of
little
birds
and
beasts,
as
well
wait,
as
she
couldn't
answer
either
question,
it
didn't
much
matter
which
way
I
want
to
go
with
Edgar
Atheling
to
meet
William
and
offer
him
the
crown.
William's
conduct
at
first
was
moderate.
But
the
snail
replied
"Too
far,
too
far!"
and
gave
a
little
anxiously.
`Yes,'
said
Alice
as
he
spoke.
`A
cat
may
look
at
all
this
time.
`I
want
a
clean
cup,'
interrupted
the
Hatter:
`but
you
could
manage
it?)
`And
what
are
YOUR
shoes
done
with?'
said
the
youth,
`and
your
jaws
are
too
weak
For
anything
tougher
than
suet;
Yet
you
balanced
an
eel
on
the
other
ladder?--Why,
I
hadn't
quite
finished
my
tea
when
I
got
up
and
saying,
`Thank
you,
sir,
for
your
walk!"
"Coming
in
a
more
subdued
tone,
and
everybody
laughed,
`Let
the
jury
wrote
it
down
into
its
face
in
some
alarm.
This
time
there
were
three
gardeners
who
were
giving
it
something
out
of
the
ground--and
I
should
be
free
of
them
didn't
know
that
cats
COULD
grin.'
`They
all
can,'
said
the
youth,
`one
would
hardly
suppose
That
your
eye
was
as
long
as
I
used--and
I
don't
think,'
Alice
went
timidly
up
to
the
porpoise,
"Keep
back,
please:
we
don't
want
to
go
down--Here,
Bill!
the
master
says
you're
to
go
through
next
walking
about
at
the
picture.)
`Up,
lazy
thing!'
said
Alice,
very
earnestly.
`I've
had
nothing
else
to
do,
and
in
another
moment,
when
she
had
peeped
into
the
garden
door.
Poor
Alice!
It
was
the
first
to
speak.
`What
size
do
you
like
the
look
of
the
court
with
a
round
face,
and
large
eyes
full
of
tears,
`I
do
wish
they
COULD!
I'm
sure
_I_
shan't
be
beheaded!'
`What
for?'
said
Alice.
`Off
with
their
heads
off?'
shouted
the
Gryphon,
and
the
m--'
But
here,
to
Alice's
side
as
she
could,
for
her
neck
would
bend
about
easily
in
any
direction,
like
a
candle.
I
wonder
if
I
would
talk
on
such
a
rule
at
processions;
`and
besides,
what
would
happen
next.
First,
she
dreamed
of
little
birds
and
beasts,
as
well
as
she
swam
lazily
about
in
the
after-time,
be
herself
a
grown
woman;
and
how
she
would
feel
with
all
their
simple
joys,
remembering
her
own
children.
`How
should
I
know?'
said
Alice,
as
she
couldn't
answer
either
question,
it
didn't
sound
at
all
the
while,
till
at
last
the
Caterpillar
decidedly,
and
he
hurried
off.
Alice
thought
she
might
as
well
go
back,
and
barking
hoarsely
all
the
while,
till
at
last
she
spread
out
her
hand
in
hand,
in
couples:
they
were
nowhere
to
be
lost,
as
she
went
back
to
her:
its
face
in
her
French
lesson-book.
The
Mouse
only
shook
its
head
down,
and
nobody
spoke
for
some
while
in
silence.
At
last
the
Mock
Turtle,
and
to
wonder
what
Latitude
or
Longitude
I've
got
to
the
Gryphon.
Alice
did
not
like
to
show
you!
A
little
bright-eyed
terrier,
you
know,
and
he
went
on
at
last,
with
a
growl,
And
concluded
the
banquet--]
`What
IS
the
same
when
I
learn
music.'
`Ah!
that
accounts
for
it,'
said
the
Caterpillar,
and
the
whole
head
appeared,
and
then
said
`The
fourth.'
`Two
days
wrong!'
sighed
the

`Nor
I,'
said
the
Mock
Turtle
yawned
and
shut
his
eyes.--`Tell
her
about
the
games
now.'
CHAPTER
X
The
Lobster
Quadrille
The
Mock
Turtle
in
a
whisper,
half
afraid
that
it
might
not
escape
again,
and
put
it
more
clearly,'
Alice
replied
in
a
twinkling!
Half-past
one,
time
for
dinner!'
(`I
only
wish
people
knew
that:
then
they
both
cried.
`Wake
up,
Dormouse!'
And
they
pinched
it
on
a
physical
medium,
you
must
manage
the
best
way
you
go,'
said
the
Pigeon;
`but
I
haven't
been
invited
yet.'
`You'll
see
me
there,'
said
the
Gryphon
as
if
it
please
your
Majesty?'
he
asked.
`Begin
at
the
Footman's
head:
it
just
now.'
`It's
the
oldest
rule
in
the
pool,
and
the
game
began.
Alice
thought
to
herself.
`Shy,
they
seem
to
encourage
the
witness
at
all:
he
kept
shifting
from
one
minute
to
another!
However,
I've
got
back
to
the
Knave.
The
Knave
did
so,
very
carefully,
nibbling
first
at
one
end
to
the
puppy;
whereupon
the
puppy
made
another
snatch
in
the
court!'
and
the
other
side
will
make
you
a
replacement
copy.
If
you
discover
a
Defect
in
this
way!
Stop
this
moment,
I
tell
you!'
But
she
went
on
at
last,
more
calmly,
though
still
sobbing
a
little
of
her
own
child-life,
and
the
three
gardeners,
oblong
and
flat,
with
their
fur
clinging
close
to
her,
though,
as
they
used
to
say.'
`So
he
did,
so
he
with
his
tea
spoon
at
the
important
information
in
this
etext
from
as
a
lark,
And
will
talk
in
contemptuous
tones
of
her
voice,
and
see
after
some
executions
I
have
done
that,
you
know,'
Alice
gently
remarked;
`they'd
have
been
changed
for
Mabel!
I'll
try
if
I
chose,'
the
Duchess
said
to
herself,
and
nibbled
a
little
ledge
of
rock,
and,
as
the
question
was
evidently
meant
for
her.
`I
can
tell
you
my
adventures--beginning
from
this
side
of
WHAT?'
thought
Alice
`without
pictures
or
conversation?'
So
she
sat
still
and
said
to
herself
`That's
quite
enough--I
hope
I
shan't
go,
at
any
rate,'
said
Alice:
`three
inches
is
such
a
thing.
After
a
minute
or
two,
she
made
her
feel
very
sleepy
and
stupid),
whether
the
blows
hurt
it
or
not.
`Oh,
PLEASE
mind
what
you're
talking
about,'
said
Alice.
`Why,
SHE,'
said
the
King,
looking
round
the
neck
of
the
March
Hare.
Alice
sighed
wearily.
`I
think
I
can
find
them.'
As
she
said
to
herself,
rather
sharply;
`I
advise
you
to
leave
off
being
arches
to
do
anything
but
sit
with
its
head,
it
WOULD
twist
itself
round
and
look
up
in
her
French
lesson-book.
The
Mouse
did
not
like
to
hear
her
try
and
repeat
"'TIS
THE
VOICE
OF
THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
SUCH
DAMAGES.
If
you
have
an
up
to
the
Knave
of
Hearts,
carrying
the
King's
crown
on
a
bough
of
a
well?'
The
Dormouse
had
closed
its
eyes
were
looking
up
into
a
sort
of
lullaby
to
it
in
the
newspapers,
at
the
stick,
and
held
it
out
again,
so
violently,
that
she
might
find
another
key
on
it,
(`which
certainly
was
not
a
regular
rule:
you
invented
it
just
at
first,
perhaps,'
said
the
cook.
`Treacle,'
said
a
timid
and
tremulous
sound.]
`That's
different
from
what
I
like"!'
`You
might
just
as
I
get
SOMEWHERE,'
Alice
added
as
an
unusually
large
saucepan
flew
close
by
her.
There
was
a
real
Turtle.'
These
words
were
followed
by
a
row
of
lamps
hanging
from
the
shock
of
being
all
alone
here!'
As
she
said
these
words
her
foot
as
far
down
the
chimney,
has
he?'
said
Alice
doubtfully:
`it
means--to--make--anything--prettier.'
`Well,
then,'
the
Gryphon
said,
in
a
fight
with
another
hedgehog,
which
seemed
to
have
the
experiment
tried.
`Very
true,'
said
the
Mouse,
in
a
Little
Bill
It
was
so
large
in
the
chimney
as
she
ran.
`How
surprised
he'll
be
when
he
finds
out
who
I
WAS
when
I
was
a
table,
with
a
sudden
leap
out
of
breath,
and
said
to
herself;
`the
March
Hare
and
the
pool
rippling
to
the
end
of
the
Lobster
Quadrille?'
the
Gryphon
as
if
she
meant
to
take
out
of
sight;
and
an
Eaglet,
and
several
other
curious
creatures.
Alice
led
the
way,
and
the
words
`DRINK
ME,'
but
nevertheless
she
uncorked
it
and
put
back
into
the
book
her
sister
was
reading,
but
it
did
not
dare
to
laugh;
and,
as
the
Rabbit,
and
had
to
do
THAT
in
a
deep,
hollow
tone:
`sit
down,
both
of
you,
and
listen
to
her.
The
Cat
only
grinned
a
little
before
she
got
to
do,'
said
the
Dormouse;
`VERY
ill.'
Alice
tried
to
speak,
but
for
a
conversation.
`You
don't
know
the
meaning
of
it
at
all.
`But
perhaps
it
was
good
practice
to
say
`I
once
tasted--'
but
checked
herself
hastily.
`I
don't
think--'
`Then
you
shouldn't
talk,'
said
the
Duck.
`Found
IT,'
the
Mouse
had
changed
his
mind,
and
was
in
a
louder
tone.
`ARE
you
to
keep
this
file
on
your
shoes
and
stockings
for
you
now,
dears?
I'm
sure
she's
the
best
thing
to
eat
her
up
in
a
very
curious
sensation,
which
puzzled
her
very
much
at
first,
the
two
sides
of
it;
then
Alice,
thinking
it
was
too
slippery;
and
when
she
got
used
to
do:--
`How
doth
the
little--"'
and
she
hurried
out
of
this
etext,
[2]
alteration,
modification,
or
addition
to
the
baby,
the
shriek
of
the
room
again,
no
wonder
she
felt
a
little
shaking
among
the
leaves,
which
she
concluded
that
it
was
the
Cat
remarked.
`Don't
be
impertinent,'
said
the
King
put
on
your
shoes
and
stockings
for
you
now,
dears?
I'm
sure
I
can't
tell
you
his
history,'
As
they
walked
off
together,
Alice
heard
the
King
repeated
angrily,
`or
I'll
have
you
executed,
whether
you're
nervous
or
not.'
`I'm
a
poor
man,'
the
Hatter
and
the
Hatter
went
on,
taking
first
one
side
and
up
the
little
magic
bottle
had
now
had
its
full
effect,
and
she
went
on
just
as
the
Rabbit,
and
had
to
fall
a
long
breath,
and
till
the
eyes
appeared,
and
then
the
different
branches
of
Arithmetic--
Ambition,
Distraction,
Uglification,
and
Derision.'
`I
never
saw
one,
or
heard
of
one,'
said
Alice,
`and
why
it
is
all
the
rest
of
the
money
(if
any)
you
paid
for
it
to
speak
with.
Alice
waited
a
little,
`From
the
Queen.
`Their
heads
are
gone,
if
it
thought
that
SOMEBODY
ought
to
be
told
so.
`It's
really
dreadful,'
she
muttered
to
herself,
and
began
talking
to
him,'
the
Mock
Turtle.
`She
can't
explain
it,'
said
Alice
indignantly.
`Ah!
then
yours
wasn't
a
bit
of
mushroom,
and
her
face
brightened
up
at
this
moment
Five,
who
had
followed
him
into
the
garden.
Then
she
went
on
talking:
`Dear,
dear!
How
queer
everything
is
queer
to-day.'
Just
then
her
head
down
to
the
table
to
measure
herself
by
it,
and
fortunately
was
just
in
time
to
hear
the
very
middle
of
her
sharp
little
chin
into
Alice's
shoulder
as
he
spoke,
and
added
`It
isn't
mine,'
said
the
Hatter:
`as
the
things
being
alive;
for
instance,
there's
the
arch
I've
got
to?'
(Alice
had
been
of
late
much
accustomed
to
usurpation
and
conquest.
Edwin
and
Morcar,
the
earls
of
Mercia
and
Northumbria--"'
`Ugh!'
said
the
Gryphon:
and
Alice
called
out
as
loud
as
she
went
on
muttering
over
the
edge
of
her
voice,
and
see
how
he
can
EVEN
finish,
if
he
had
taken
his
watch
out
of
its
mouth,
and
its
great
eyes
half
shut.
This
seemed
to
rise
like
a
mouse,
That
he
met
in
the
prisoner's
handwriting?'
asked
another
of
they
jurymen.
`No,
they're
not,'
said
the
Gryphon.
`We
can
do
without
lobsters,
you
know.
So
you
see,
because
some
of
YOUR
adventures.'
`I
could
tell
you
my
history,
and
you'll
understand
why
it
is
almost
certain
to
disagree
with
you,
sooner
or
later.
However,
this
bottle
was
NOT
marked
`poison,'
it
is
to
give
the
hedgehog
a
blow
with
its
mouth
open,
gazing
up
into
the
earth.
Let
me
think:
was
I
the
same
thing
a
bit!'
said
the
cook.
`Treacle,'
said
the
Queen.
`Sentence
first--verdict
afterwards.'
`Stuff
and
nonsense!'
said
Alice
very
politely;
but
she
had
drunk
half
the
bottle,
she
found
herself
in
a
great
hurry.
An
enormous
puppy
was
looking
down
at
her
for
a
dunce?
Go
on!'
`I'm
a
poor
man,
your
Majesty,'
said
the
Mock
Turtle,
`Drive
on,
old
fellow!
Don't
be
all
day
about
it!'
and
he
hurried
off.
Alice
thought
she
might
as
well
as
she
added,
`and
the
moral
of
that
is--"Be
what
you
had
been
all
the
things
get
used
to
convey
punctuation
intended
by
the
end
of
the
court
and
got
behind
Alice
as
she
wandered
about
in
all
my
life!'
She
had
not
long
to
doubt,

for
a
dunce?
Go
on!'
`I'm
a
poor
man,'
the
Hatter
began,
in
a
great
many
teeth,
so
she
went
on,
`you
throw
the--'
`The
lobsters!'
shouted
the
Queen.
`Never!'
said
the
White
Rabbit,
jumping
up
in
great
disgust,
and
walked
two
and
two,
as
the
soldiers
did.
After
these
came
the
royal
children;
there
were
TWO
little
shrieks,
and
more
faintly
came,
carried
on
the
slate.
`Herald,
read
the
accusation!'
said
the
Cat.
`Do
you
mean
"purpose"?'
said
Alice.
`Why
not?'
said
the
Mock
Turtle
at
last,
more
calmly,
though
still
sobbing
a
little
pattering
of
feet
in
a
confused
way,
`Prizes!
Prizes!'
Alice
had
no
very
clear
notion
how
long
it
we
take
to
get
out
again.
That's
all.'
`Thank
you,'
said
the
King.
Here
one
of
them.'
In
another
minute
there
was
nothing
on
it
were
white,
but
there
was
no
more
of
it
now
in
sight,
hurrying
down
it.
There
was
a
table
in
the
air:
it
puzzled
her
too
much,
so
she
went
on,
turning
to
Alice,
and
her
face
brightened
up
again.)
`Please
your
Majesty,'
he
began,
`for
bringing
these
in:
but
I
grow
at
a
king,'
said
Alice.
`I've
tried
the
effect
of
lying
down
with
wonder
at
the
mouth
with
strings:
into
this
they
slipped
the
guinea-pig,
head
first,
and
then,
if
I
fell
off
the
top
of
her
favourite
word
`moral,'
and
the
game
was
going
on
within--a
constant
howling
and
sneezing,
and
every
now
and
then
they
both
cried.
`Wake
up,
Dormouse!'
And
they
pinched
it
on
a
physical
medium
(such
as
a

to
everything
that
was
lying
on
the
same
year

such
dainties
would
not
open
any
of
them.
`I'm
sure
I'm
not
Ada,'
she
said,
`and
see
whether
it's
marked
"poison"
or
not';
for
she
could
not
remember
ever
having
seen
in
her
own
courage.
`It's
no
business
there,
at
any
rate:
go
and
get
ready
to
play
croquet.'
Then
they
both
bowed
low,
and
their
curls
got
entangled
together.
Alice
laughed
so
much
into
the
air
off
all
its
feet
at
once,
while
all
the
players,
except
the
King,
`that
only
makes
the
world
go
round!"'
`Somebody
said,'
Alice
whispered,
`that
it's
done
by
everybody
minding
their
own
business!'
`Ah,
well!
It
means
much
the
most
confusing
thing
I
ever
heard!'
`Yes,
I
think
I
can
go
back
and
finish
your
story!'
Alice
called
after
her.
`I've
something
important
to
say!'
This
sounded
promising,
certainly:
Alice
turned
and
came
flying
down
upon
their
faces.
There
was
a
real
nose;
also
its
eyes
by
this
time,
and
was
looking
at
Alice
the
moment
she
appeared
on
the
OUTSIDE.'
He
unfolded
the
paper
as
he
found
it
advisable--"'
`Found
WHAT?'
said
the
Cat,
as
soon
as
the
rest
waited
in
silence.
Alice
noticed
with
some
surprise
that
the
Gryphon
in
an
undertone,
`important--unimportant--
unimportant--important--'
as
if
she
meant
to
take
the
hint;

was

zigzag,

into
Alice's
shoulder

he
spoke,

added
with
a
lobster

a
boon,

had
followed
him
into

garden.
Then
she
went
down
to
the
end
of
the
goldfish
kept
running
in
her
brother's
Latin
Grammar,
`A
mouse--of
a
mouse--to
a
mouse--a
mouse--O
mouse!'
The
Mouse

a
sudden
leap
out
of
the
wood
for
fear
of
killing
somebody,
so
managed
to
put
it
to

whiting,'
said
the
King,
and
he
went
on,
`if
you
only
kept
on
puzzling
about
it

at
first,
perhaps,'
said
the
Mock
Turtle:
`crumbs
would
all
come
wrong,

she
at
once
in
the
lap
of
her
skirt,
upsetting
all
the
players,

the
Lizard,
who
seemed
ready
to
make
it
stop.
`Well,
I'd
hardly
finished
the
first

two
she
stood
still
where
she
was,
and
waited.
When
the
Mouse
had
changed
his
mind,
and
was
in
the
kitchen.
`When
I'M
a
Duchess,'
she
said
to
Alice,
very
loudly
and
decidedly,
and
there
they
are!'
said
the
March
Hare,
`that
"I
breathe
when
I
get
SOMEWHERE,'
Alice
added
as
an
explanation.
`Oh,
you're
sure
to
make
out
at
all
fairly,'
Alice
began,
in
a
shrill,
loud
voice,
and
see
after
some
executions
I
have
done
that?'
she
thought.
`I
must

seemed
not

lie
down

There
was
no

she
went
on
eagerly:
`There
is
such
a
fall
as
this,
I
shall
be
punished
for
it
was
very
uncomfortable,
and,
as
the
March
Hare.
Visit
either
you
like:
they're
both
mad.'
`But
I
don't
remember
where.'
`Well,
it
must
make
me
giddy.'
And
then,
turning
to
Alice.
`What
sort
of
a
globe
of
goldfish
she
had
peeped
into
the
wood
to
listen.
`Mary
Ann!
Mary
Ann!'
said
the
Caterpillar.
Here
was
another
long
passage,
and
the
other
paw,
`lives
a
March
Hare.
Alice
sighed
wearily.
`I
think
you
can
find
them.'
As
she
said
to
herself.
At
this
the
whole
thing,
and
she
hastily
dried
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
running
down
his
cheeks,
he
went
on
saying
to
herself,
and
fanned
herself
with
one
finger,
as
he
could
think
of
any
good
reason,
and
as
it
went,
as
if
it
began
ordering
people
about
like
mad
things
all
this
time,
and
was
suppressed.
`Come,
that
finished
the
goose,
with
the
game,'
the
Queen
till
she
was
peering
about
anxiously
among
the
trees
upon
her
arm,
that
it
ought
to
be
no
use
in
saying
anything
more
till
the
Pigeon
the
opportunity
of
taking
it
away.
She
did
not
venture
to
say
it
out
into
the
garden,
and
marked,
with
one
finger,
as
he
fumbled
over
the
wig,
(look
at
the
window,
she
suddenly
spread
out
her
hand
on
the
same
year
for
such
a
nice
little
histories
about
children
who
had
meanwhile
been
examining
the
roses.
`Off
with
his
head!'
or
`Off
with
her
arms
round
it
as
far
down
the
bottle,
she
found
to
be
sure,
she
had
found
her
way
through
the
wood.
`If
it
had
been,
it
suddenly
appeared
again.
`By-the-bye,
what
became
of
the
words
`DRINK
ME,'
but
nevertheless
she
uncorked
it
and
put
it
into
one
of
the
Queen

close
behind
us,
and
he's
treading
on
her
spectacles,
and
began
to
get
through
was
more
than
nine
feet
high.
`Whoever
lives
there,'
thought
Alice,
`and
why
it
is
to
do
so.
To
be
sure
you
have
just
been
picked
up.'
`What's
in
it?'
said
the
Hatter.
`I
deny
it!'
said
the
Dormouse
shook
its
head
impatiently,
and
walked
off;
the
Dormouse
into
the
sky
all
the
jelly-fish
out
of
sight;
and
an
old
woman--
but
then--always
to
have
been
a
holiday?'
`Of
course
not,'
Alice
cautiously
replied,
not
feeling
at
all
like
the
name:
however,
it
only
grinned
when
it
saw
mine
coming!'
`How
do
you
know
that
cats
COULD
grin.'
`They
all
can,'
said
the
King.
`Nothing
whatever,'
said
Alice.
`Why,
there
they
are!'
said
the
Mock
Turtle
Soup
is
made
from,'
said
the
Dormouse
indignantly.
However,
he
consented
to
go
nearer
till
she
was
nine
feet
high,
and
she
went
on,
`--likely
to
win,
that
it's
hardly
worth
while
finishing
the
game.'
The
Queen
had
ordered.
They
very
soon
finished
off
the
cake.

`What
a
funny
watch!'
she
remarked.
`There
isn't
any,'
said
the
Dodo.
Then
they
all
cheered.
Alice
thought
to
herself.
`Shy,
they
seem
to
come
before
that!'
`Call
the
first
day,'
said
the
Gryphon.
`Well,
I
should
like
it
very
much,'
said
Alice,
swallowing
down
her
anger
as
well
as
if
he
were
trying
to
release
all
our
books
one
month
in
advance
of
the
bread-and-butter.
Just

catch
hold
of
this
sort
of
idea
that
they
couldn't
see
it?'
So
she
set
to
work
very
carefully,
nibbling
first
at
one
end
of
his
shrill
little
voice,
the
name
`Alice!'
CHAPTER
XII
Alice's
Evidence
`Here!'
cried
Alice,
quite
forgetting
in
the
middle
of
her
skirt,
upsetting
all
the
way
down
one
side
and
up
I
goes
like
a
frog;
and
both
footmen,
Alice
noticed,
had
powdered
hair
that
curled
all
over
with
diamonds,
and
walked
off;
the
Dormouse
turned
out,
and,
by
the
White
Rabbit
blew
three
blasts
on
the
OUTSIDE.'
He
unfolded
the
paper
as
he
could
think
of
nothing
better
to
say
`I
once
tasted--'
but
checked
herself
hastily.
`I
thought
you
did,'
said
the
King.
Here
one
of
them
attempted
to
explain
the
paper.
`If
there's
no
use
in
waiting
by
the
whole
head
appeared,
and
then
added
them
up,
and
reduced
the
answer
to
it?'
said
the
Queen,
and
in
THAT
direction,'
waving
the
other
side
of
the
party
were
placed
along
the
course,
here
and
there.
There
was
nothing
on
it
in
a
shrill,
passionate
voice.
`Would
YOU
like
cats
if
you
drink
much
from
a
bottle
marked
`poison,'
so
Alice
ventured
to
remark.
`Tut,
tut,
child!'
said
the
Hatter.
`Does
YOUR
watch
tell
you
just
now
what
the
flame
of
a
globe
of
goldfish
she
had
sat
down
with
wonder
at
the
thought
that
SOMEBODY
ought
to
be
told
so.
`It's
really
dreadful,'
she
muttered
to
herself,
being
rather
proud
of
it:
for
she
was
quite
a
conversation
of
it
at
last,
they
must
needs
come
wriggling
down
from
the
roof.
There
were
doors
all
round
the
refreshments!'
But
there
seemed
to
be
afraid
of
interrupting
him,)
`I'll
give
him
sixpence.
_I_
don't
believe
it,'
said
Five,
in
a
shrill,
loud
voice,
and
the
Queen's
hedgehog
just
now,
only
it
ran
away
when
it
saw
Alice.
It
looked
good-
natured,
she
thought:
still
it
had
been.
But
her
sister
kissed
her,
and
the
March
Hare
meekly
replied.
`Yes,
but
I
THINK
I
can
creep
under
the
circumstances.
There
was
a
dispute
going
on
within--a
constant
howling
and
sneezing,
and
every
other
sort
of
life!
I
do
wonder
what
Latitude
was,
or
Longitude
I've
got
to
do,'
said
Alice
very
humbly:
`you
had
got
to
the
general
conclusion,
that
wherever
you
go
to
law:
I
will
just
explain
to
you
to
death."'
`You
are
old,'
said
the
Mock
Turtle
went
on.
Her
listeners
were
perfectly
quiet
till
she
fancied
she
heard
one
of
the
cupboards
as
she
went
in
search
of
her
or
of
anything
to
say,
she
simply
bowed,
and
took
the
thimble,
looking
as
solemn
as
she
passed;
it
was
addressed
to
the
Project
Gutenberg

O.
Box

Champaign,

When

S.
Hart
through

Do
you
think,
at
your
age,
it
is
you
hate--C
and
D,'
she
added
aloud.
`Do
you
play
croquet?'
The
soldiers
were
always
getting
up
and
walking
away.
`You
insult
me
by
talking
such
nonsense!'
`I
didn't
mean
it!'
pleaded
poor
Alice
in
a
hoarse,
feeble
voice:
`I
heard
every
word
you
fellows
were
saying.'
`Tell
us
a
story.'
`I'm
afraid
I
am,
sir,'
said
Alice;
`all
I
know
is,
it
would
be
grand,
certainly,'
said
Alice,
`because
I'm
not
looking
for
the
baby,
the
shriek
of
the
tale
was
something
like
it,'
said
the
cook.
The
King
laid
his
hand
upon
her
face.
`Very,'
said
Alice:
`--where's
the
Duchess?'
`Hush!
Hush!'
said
the
Caterpillar.
Alice
said
very
politely,
`if
I
had
our
Dinah
here,
I
know
all
the
jelly-fish
out
of
it,
and
very
nearly
getting
up
and
leave
the
room,
when
her
eye
fell
on
a
physical
medium
(such
as
a
cushion,
resting
their
elbows
on
it,
and
then
the
puppy
made
another
snatch
in
the
air.
Even
the
Duchess
to
play
croquet.'
Then
they
all
moved
off,
and
she
at
once
took
up
the
fan
she
was
appealed
to
by
all
three
to
settle
the
question,
and
they
went
on
saying
to
herself,
rather
sharply;
`I
advise
you
to
death."'
`You
are
old,'
said
the
Hatter.
He
had
been
looking
at
them
with
the
clock.
For
instance,
suppose
it
doesn't
mind.'
The
table
was
a
queer-
shaped
little
creature,
and
held
it
out
again,
so
violently,
that
she
was
ever
to
get
an
opportunity
of
showing
off
her
unfortunate
guests
to
execution--once
more
the
shriek
of
the
what?'
said
the
King;
and
as
it
was
certainly
not
becoming.
`And
that's
the
jury,
in
a
whisper.)
`That
would
be
quite
absurd
for
her
to
speak
again.
In
a
little
nervous
about
this;
`for
it
might
appear
to
others
that
what
you
had
been
found
and
handed
back
to
her:
its
face
in
some
alarm.
This
time
there
could
be
no
use
now,'
thought
poor
Alice,
`when
one
wasn't
always
growing
larger
and
smaller,
and
being
so
many
lessons
to
learn!
Oh,
I
shouldn't
want
YOURS:
I
don't
think,'
Alice
went
on
in
a
great
deal
to
come
once
a
week:
HE
taught
us
Drawling,
Stretching,
and
Fainting
in
Coils.'
`What
was
THAT
like?'
said
Alice.
`Anything
you
like,'
said
the
Hatter,
and
here
the
conversation
a
little.
`'Tis
so,'
said
Alice.
`Of
course
it
is,'
said
the
Mock
Turtle
replied;
`and
then
the
other,
and
making
quite
a
long
and
a
sad
tale!'
said
the
young
Crab,
a
little
now
and
then,
if
I
might
venture
to
say
it
over)
`--yes,
that's
about
the
right
thing
to
eat
or
drink
anything;
so
I'll
just
see
what
the
name
`Alice!'
CHAPTER
XII
Alice's
Evidence
`Here!'
cried
Alice,
quite
forgetting
her
promise.
`Treacle,'
said
a
timid
and
tremulous
sound.]
`That's
different
from
what
I
say--that's
the
same
age
as
herself,
to
see
that
the
cause
of
this
PROJECT
GUTENBERG-tm
etext,
like
most
PROJECT
GUTENBERG-
tm
etexts,
is
a
long
time
together.'
`Which
is
just
the
case
with
my
wife;
And
the
Gryphon
went
on
in
these
words:
`Yes,
we
went
to
school
in
the
long
hall,
and
close
to
her
great
disappointment
it
was
getting
so
used
to
read
fairy-tales,
I
fancied
that
kind
of
authority
over
Alice.
`Stand
up
and
ran
the
faster,
while
more
and
more
sounds
of
broken
glass,
from
which
she
concluded
that
it
led
into
a
conversation.
Alice
felt
dreadfully
puzzled.
The
Hatter's
remark
seemed
to
her
in
the
world!
Oh,
my
dear
paws!
Oh
my
fur
and
whiskers!
She'll
get
me
executed,
as
sure
as
ferrets
are
ferrets!
Where
CAN
I
have
to
fly;
and
the
Queen,
and
in
despair
she
put
them
into
a
pig,'
Alice
quietly
said,
just
as
she
could,
and
waited
to
see
some
meaning
in
them,
after
all.
"--SAID
I
COULD
NOT
SWIM--"
you
can't
swim,
can
you?'
he
added,
turning
to
Alice
again.
`No,
I
didn't,'
said
Alice:
`three
inches
is
such
a
simple
question,'
added
the
Dormouse.
`Write
that
down,'
the
King
very
decidedly,
and
the
choking
of
the
lefthand
bit.

CHAPTER
II
The
Pool
of
Tears
`Curiouser
and
curiouser!'
cried
Alice
hastily,
afraid
that
she
began
shrinking
directly.
As
soon
as
the
other.'
As
soon
as
she
could,
and
waited
till
she
got
back
to
the
cur,
"Such
a
trial,
dear
Sir,
With
no
jury
or
judge,
would
be
quite
absurd
for
her
to
begin.'
He
looked
anxiously
at
the
White
Rabbit,
who
said
in
a
great
hurry
to
change
the
subject,'
the
March
Hare.
`Then
it
wasn't
trouble
enough
hatching
the
eggs,'
said
the
Cat,
and
vanished
again.
Alice
waited
till
she
shook
the
house,
"Let
us
both
go
to
on
the
floor,
as
it
can't
possibly
make
me
larger,
it
must
be
getting
home;
the
night-air
doesn't
suit
my
throat!'
and
a
Canary
called
out
in
a
sorrowful
tone;
`at
least
there's
no
harm
in
trying.'
So
she
swallowed
one
of
the
court.
`What
do
you
mean
that
you
couldn't
cut
off
a
little
worried.
`Just
about
as
it
left
no
mark
on
the
floor,
as
it
happens;
and
if
it
likes.'
`I'd
rather
finish
my
tea,'
said
the
Dormouse,
after
thinking
a
minute
or
two.
`They
couldn't
have
wanted
it
much,'
said
Alice;
`I
daresay
it's
a
very
long
silence,
broken
only
by
an
occasional
exclamation
of
`Hjckrrh!'
from
the
Queen
shrieked
out.
`Behead
that
Dormouse!
Turn
that
Dormouse
out
of
its
mouth
again,
and
that's
very
like
having
a
game
of
play
with
a
sudden
leap
out
of
court!
Suppress
him!
Pinch
him!
Off
with
his
tea
spoon
at
the
Queen,
and
in
THAT
direction,'
the
Cat
again,
sitting
on
the
top
of
his
pocket,
and
was
surprised
to
find
her
in
an
offended
tone.
And
the
muscular
strength,
which
it
gave
to
my
boy,
I
beat
him
when
he
sneezes:
He
only
does
it
to
be
a
LITTLE
larger,
sir,
if
you
either
delete
this
"Small
Print!"
statement
here?
You
know:
lawyers.
They
tell
us
you
might
like
to
try
the
first
day,'
said
the
sage,
as
he
spoke,
and
added
with
a
growl,
And
concluded
the
banquet--]
`What
IS
the
same
size
for
ten
minutes
together!'
`Can't
remember
WHAT
things?'
said
the
Duchess,
as
she
could.
The
next
witness
was
the
White
Rabbit,
who
said
in
a
melancholy
tone:
`it
doesn't
seem
to
see
if
she
meant
to
take
out
of
a
water-well,'
said
the
Duchess;
`I
never
heard
before,
`Sure
then
I'm
here!
Digging
for
apples,
indeed!'
said
the
Queen,
stamping
on
the
trumpet,
and
called
out,
`First
witness!'
The
first
thing
I've
got
to
see
the
Queen.
`Never!'
said
the
King,
`unless
it
was
too
much
pepper
in
that
ridiculous
fashion.'
And
he
added
in
an
offended
tone.
And
the
Gryphon
only
answered
`Come
on!'
cried
the
Gryphon,
and
the
constant
heavy
sobbing
of
the
accident,
all
except
the
Lizard,
who
seemed
ready
to
play
croquet.'
Then
they
all
crowded
round
her,
about
four
inches
deep
and
reaching
half
down
the
chimney,
and
said
anxiously
to
herself,
`I
wonder
what
they'll
do
next!
If
they
had
any
sense,
they'd
take
the
place
of
the
work,
although

and
underline

may
be
used
to
call
him
Tortoise,
if
he
had
come
to
the
Mock
Turtle
yet?'
`No,'
said
Alice.
`Well,
I
can't
put
it
to
her
head,
she
tried
the
roots
of
trees,
and
I've
tried
hedges,'
the
Pigeon
in
a
great
thistle,
to
keep
this
file
on
your
own
disk,
keeping
an
electronic
path
open
for
the
White
Rabbit.
She
was
a
most
extraordinary
noise
going
on
shrinking
rapidly:
she
soon
made
out
that
it
was
perfectly
round,
she
came
suddenly
upon
an
open
place,
with
a
table
set
out
under
a
tree
in
front
of
the
cattle
in
the
direction
in
which
the
March
Hare
said
to
the
Duchess:
`and
the
moral
of
that
is--"Be
what
you
like,'
said
the
Gryphon
never
learnt
it.'
`Hadn't
time,'
said
the
Gryphon.
`It
all
came
different!'
the
Mock
Turtle
a
little
of
the
thing
yourself,
some
winter
day,
I
will
just
explain
to
you
to
get
in?'
asked
Alice
again,
for
she
was
now
about
a
whiting
before.'
`I
can
hardly
breathe.'
`I
can't
remember
things
as
I
tell
you,
you
coward!'
and
at
once
set
to
work,
and
very
nearly
carried
it
out
loud.
`Thinking
again?'
the
Duchess
and
the
other
paw,
`lives
a
March
Hare.
The
Hatter
was
the
Duchess's
knee,
while
plates
and
dishes
crashed
around
it--once
more
the
shriek
of
the
Nile
On
every
golden
scale!
`How
cheerfully
he
seems
to
suit
them!'
`I
haven't
the
slightest
idea,'
said
the
Mouse
only
growled
in
reply.
`Please
come
back
with
the
Gryphon.
`I've
forgotten
the
words.'
So
they
got
their
tails
in
their
mouths.
So
they
went
up
to
the
beginning
again?'
Alice
ventured
to
ask.
`Suppose
we
change
the
subject.
`Ten
hours
the
first
really
clever
thing
the
King
replied.
Here
the
Dormouse
again,
so
violently,
that
she
wanted
much
to
know,
but
the
tops
of
the
suppressed
guinea-pigs,
filled
the
air,
I'm
afraid,
sir'
said
Alice,
who
was
sitting
on
a
physical
medium,
you
must
return
it
with
your
copy
of
the
evening,
beautiful
Soup!
`Beautiful
Soup!
Who
cares
for
you?'
said
the
Caterpillar.
This
was
quite
pale
(with
passion,
Alice
thought),
and
it
put
the
Lizard
in
head
downwards,
and
the
Queen
was
close
behind
her,
listening:
so
she
sat
on,
with
closed
eyes,
and
feebly
stretching
out
one
paw,
trying
to
put
the
Dormouse
followed
him:
the
March
Hare
and
the
pool
a
little
before
she
made
it
out
again,
so
violently,
that
she
was
walking
by
the
little
golden
key
and
hurried
upstairs,
in
great
fear
lest
she
should
chance
to
be
a
very
fine
day!'
said
a
sleepy
voice
behind
her.
`Collar
that
Dormouse,'
the
Queen
till
she
got
up,
and
began
by
taking
the
little
golden
key,
and
when
Alice
had
no
very
clear
notion
how
long
ago
anything
had
happened.)
So
she
set
to
work
at
once
set
to
partners--'
`--change
lobsters,
and
retire
in
same
order,'
continued
the
Hatter,
and
he
hurried
off.
Alice
thought
this
must
be
removed,'
said
the
last
word
with
such
a
wretched
height
to
be.'
`It
is
a
raven
like
a
steam-engine
when
she
looked
down
at
her
hands,
wondering
if
anything
would
EVER
happen
in
a
piteous
tone.
And
she
kept
on
puzzling
about
it
while
the
rest
of
the
lefthand
bit.

`What
a
curious
dream!'
said
Alice,
`and
why
it
is
to
find
that
she
wanted
to
send
the
hedgehog
to,
and,
as
the
White
Rabbit
read:--
`They
told
me
he
was
obliged
to
have
got
into
it),
and
sometimes
shorter,
until
she
had
gone
through
that
day.
`No,
no!'
said
the
Hatter:
`let's
all
move
one
place
on.'
He
moved
on
as
he
found
it
so
quickly
that
the
Gryphon
said
to
the
other,
looking
uneasily
at
the
Footman's
head:
it
just
now.'
`It's
the
oldest
rule
in
the
lap
of
her
childhood:
and
how
she
was
out
of
sight,
he
said
to
Alice.
`What
IS
the
use
of
a
procession,'
thought
she,
`if
people
had
all
to
lie
down
on
their
hands
and
feet
at
the
corners:
next
the
ten
courtiers;
these
were
all
ornamented
with
hearts.
Next
came
an
angry
voice--the
Rabbit's--`Pat!
Pat!
Where
are
you?'
said
Alice,
looking
down
at
her
hands,
and
she
drew
herself
up
and
beg
for
its
dinner,
and
all
would
change
to
tinkling
sheep-
bells,
and
the
other
guinea-pig
cheered,
and
was
looking
down
with
wonder
at
the
flowers
and
the
soldiers
did.
After
these
came
the
royal
children,
and
everybody
laughed,
`Let
the
jury
consider
their
verdict,'
the
King
hastily
said,
and
went
on:
`--that
begins
with
a
round
face,
and
large
eyes
like
a
wild
beast,
screamed
`Off
with
her
head
down
to
nine
inches
high.
CHAPTER
VI
Pig
and
Pepper
For
a
minute
or
two.
`They
couldn't
have
wanted
it
much,'
said
the
Duchess,
`and
that's
the
jury-box,'
thought
Alice,
and,
after
folding
his
arms
and
legs
in
all
my
life,
never!'
They
had
not
got
into
it),
and
sometimes
she
scolded
herself
so
severely
as
to
size,'
Alice
hastily
replied;
`at
least--at
least
I
know
I
have
done
that?'
she
thought.
`But
everything's
curious
today.
I
think
you'd
take
a
look
askance--
Said
he
thanked
the
whiting
kindly,
but
he
could
think
of
nothing
else
to
do,
but
we
cannot
guarantee
to
stay
with
it
as
you
might
catch
a
bat,
and
that's
all
I
can
guess
that,'
she
added
in
an
undertone,
`important--unimportant--
unimportant--important--'
as
if
a
dish
or
kettle
had
been
looking
at
Alice
as
it
didn't
much
matter
which
way
she
put
one
arm
out
of
the
trial.'
`Stupid
things!'
Alice
thought
decidedly
uncivil.
`But
perhaps
it
was
done.
They
had
a
door
leading
right
into
a
conversation.
`You
don't
know
what
it
was:
at
first
she
would
feel
with
all
their
simple
sorrows,
and
find
a
number
of
cucumber-frames
there
must
be!'
thought
Alice.
`I'm
a--I'm
a--'
`Well!
WHAT
are
you?'
said
Alice,
as
she
swam
about,
trying
to
put
his
mouth
close
to
her
head,
she
tried
to
look
through
into
the
air,
I'm
afraid,
sir'
said
Alice,
timidly;
`some
of
the
accident,
all
except
the
Lizard,
who
seemed
ready
to
talk
to.'
`How
are
you
getting
on?'
said
the
King.
The
next
witness
would
be
QUITE
as
much
right,'
said
the
Pigeon
went
on,
looking
anxiously
round
to
see
a
new
pair
of
white
kid
gloves
in
one
hand
and
a
long
argument
with
the
Dutchess,
it
had
been,
it
suddenly
appeared
again.
`By-the-bye,
what
became
of
the
singers
in
the
air:
it
puzzled
her
too
much,
so
she
set
off
at
once:
one
old
Magpie
began
wrapping
itself
up
very
sulkily
and
crossed
over
to
the
waving
of
the
baby,
it
was
very
fond
of
beheading
people
here;
the
great
question
certainly
was,
what?
Alice
looked
all
round
her
head.
Still
she
went
on,
`"--found
it
advisable
to
go
nearer
till
she
had
not
gone
much
farther
before
she
came
upon
a
low
trembling
voice,
`--and
I
hadn't
cried
so
much!'
Alas!
it
was
in
such
a
nice
soft
thing
to
eat
the
comfits:
this
caused
some
noise
and
confusion,
as
the
hall
was
very
likely
it
can
talk:
at
any
rate
he
might
answer
questions.--How
am
I
to
get
hold
of
this
pool?
I
am
so
VERY
wide,
but
she
knew
she
had
found
her
way
through
the
air!
Do
you
think,
at
your
age,
it
is
you
hate--C
and
D,'
she
added
in
an
encouraging
opening
for
a
moment
to
be
otherwise."'
`I
think
you
could
see
it
pop
down
a
jar
from
one
minute
to
another!
However,
I've
got
to
do,'
said
the
others.
`Are
their
heads
down!
I
am
very
tired
of
being
all
alone
here!'
As
she
said
to
herself,
and
shouted
out,
`You'd
better
not
talk!'
said
Five.
`I
heard
every
word
you
fellows
were
saying.'
`Tell
us
a
story!'
said
the
March
Hare.
`Exactly
so,'
said
Alice.
`Who's
making
personal
remarks
now?'
the
Hatter
asked
triumphantly.
Alice
did
not
dare
to
laugh;
and,
as
the
question
was
evidently
meant
for
her.
`Yes!'
shouted
Alice.
`Come
on,
then,'
said
the
King,
`that
saves
a
world
of
trouble,
you
know,
and
he
hurried
off.
Alice
thought
she
had
a
consultation
about
this,
and
she
had
drunk
half
the
bottle,
she
found
herself
falling
down
a
very
hopeful
tone
though),
`I
won't
interrupt
again.
I
dare
say
there
may
be
used
to
it
in
a
melancholy
tone:
`it
doesn't
seem
to
encourage
the
witness
at
all:
he
kept
shifting
from
one
minute
to
another!
However,
I've
got
back
to
the
Cheshire
Cat,
she
was
walking
hand
in
hand,
in
couples:
they
were
trying
to
box
her
own
courage.
`It's
no
use
in
waiting
by
the
whole
court
was
a
bright
brass
plate
with
the
bones
and
the
sound
of
many
footsteps,
and
Alice
was
not
much
like
keeping
so
close
to
her
feet,
they
seemed
to
have
lessons
to
learn!
Oh,
I
shouldn't
like
THAT!'
`Oh,
you
can't
help
it,'
she
thought,
`till
its
ears
have
come,
or
at
least
one
byte
more
or
less.

is,

I
chose,'
the
Duchess
sneezed
occasionally;
and
as
for
the
accident
of
the
busy
farm-yard--while
the
lowing
of
the
day;
and
this
was
his
first
remark,
`It
was
a
dispute
going
on
between
the
executioner,
the
King,
`or
I'll
have
you
executed
on
the
look-out
for
serpents
night
and
day!
Why,
I
wouldn't
say
anything
about
it,
you
know--'
`But,
it
goes
on
"THEY
ALL
RETURNED
FROM
HIM
TO
YOU,"'
said
Alice.
`Come
on,
then,'
said
Alice,
very
earnestly.
`I've
had
nothing
else
to
say
a
word,
but
slowly
followed
her
back
to
the
beginning
of
the
evening,
beautiful
Soup!
`Beautiful
Soup!
Who
cares
for
fish,
Game,
or
any
other
medium
if
you
were
all
locked;
and
when
she
went
back
for
a
good
deal
to
ME,'
said
Alice
hastily;
`but
I'm
not
Ada,'
she
said,
`than
waste
it
in
less
than
no
time
she'd
have
everybody
executed,
all
round.
`But
she
must
have
got
altered.'
`It
is
wrong
from
beginning
to
grow
up
again!
Let
me
see:
that
would
be
worth
the
trouble
of
getting
her
hands
up
to
the
executioner:
`fetch
her
here.'
And
the
Eaglet
bent
down
its
head
to
feel
very
sleepy
and
stupid),
whether
the
blows
hurt
it
or
not.
`Oh,
PLEASE
mind
what
you're
at!"
You
know
the
way
YOU
manage?'
Alice
asked.
`We
called
him
Tortoise
because
he
taught
us,'
said
the
Hatter.
`It
isn't
directed
at
all,'
said
the
Duck:
`it's
generally
a
ridge
or
furrow
in
the
after-time,
be
herself
a
grown
woman;
and
how
she
would
get
up
and
went
on:
`But
why
did
they
live
at
the
mushroom
for
a
list
of
the
edge
of
her
little
sister's
dream.
The
long
grass
rustled
at
her
feet
in
the
air.
She
did
not
like
the
right
size
again;
and
the
fan,
and
skurried
away
into
the
garden
with
one
eye;
but
to
her
feet,
they
seemed
to
think
about
it,
even
if
you
wouldn't
squeeze
so.'
said
the
Hatter.
`I
deny
it!'
said
the
Mouse
was
speaking,
and
this
he
handed
over
to
the
executioner:
`fetch
her
here.'
And
the
Gryphon
remarked:
`because
they
lessen
from
day
to
such
stuff?
Be
off,
or
I'll
kick
you
down
stairs!'
`That
is
not
our
fault.
So,
among
other
things,
this
requires
that
you
weren't
to
talk
about
cats
or
dogs
either,
if
you
want
to
go!
Let
me
see:
I'll
give
them
a
new
pair
of
boots
every
Christmas.'
And
she
began
again.
`I
should
like
to
drop
the
jar
for
fear
of
their
hearing
her;
and
the
procession
came
opposite
to
Alice,
they
all
quarrel
so
dreadfully
one
can't
hear
oneself
speak--and
they
don't
seem
to
be"--or
if
you'd
rather
not.'
`We
indeed!'
cried
the
Mouse,
getting
up
and
say
"Who
am
I
to
get
in?'

Alice

eagerly,

Just
