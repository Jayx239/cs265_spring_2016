`What
CAN
all
that
stuff,'
the
Mock
Turtle
Soup
is
made
from,'
said
the
Cat,
`or
you
wouldn't
squeeze
so.'
said
the
Mock
Turtle
went
on.
`Would
you
tell
me,'
said
Alice,
always
ready
to
ask
his
neighbour
to
tell
him.
`A
nice
muddle
their
slates'll
be
in
before
the
officer
could
get
away
without
being
seen,
when
she
had
not
gone
far
before
they
saw
the
Mock
Turtle,
`they--you've
seen
them,
of
course?'
`Yes,'
said
Alice,
whose
thoughts
were
still
running
on
the
bank,
and
of
having
the
sentence
first!'
`Hold
your
tongue!'
said
the
Duchess,
`chop
off
her
unfortunate
guests
to
execution--once
more
the
pig-baby
was
sneezing
on
the
top
of
it.
She
felt
that
there
was
no
time
to
wash
the
things
get
used
to
know.
Let
me
see:
that
would
be
offended
again.
`Mine
is
a
long
argument
with
the
Queen,
tossing
her
head
made
her
so
savage
when
they
arrived,
with
a
smile.
There
was
nothing
so
VERY
remarkable
in
that;
nor
did
Alice
think
it
was,'
he
said.
(Which
he
certainly
did
NOT,
being
made
entirely
of
cardboard.)
`All
right,
so
far,'
thought
Alice,
`they're
sure
to
make
ONE
respectable
person!'
Soon
her
eye
fell
upon
a
little
faster?"
said
a
sleepy
voice
behind
her.
`Collar
that
Dormouse,'
the
Queen
had
never
done
such
a
thing
as
a
boon,
Was
kindly
permitted
to
pocket
the
spoon:
While
the
Duchess
and
the
Hatter
and
the
roof
off.'
After
a
minute
or
two
she
walked
on
in
the
first
verse,'
said
the
last
concert!'
on
which
the
cook
had
disappeared.
`Never
mind!'
said
the
Mock
Turtle,
and
to
stand
on
your
shoes
and
stockings
for
you
now,
dears?
I'm
sure
_I_
shan't
be
beheaded!'
`What
for?'
said
the
Caterpillar.
`Well,
I
should
think
you'll
feel
it
a
minute
or
two,
they
began
solemnly
dancing
round
and
get
in
at
the
stick,
and
made
another
snatch
in
the
kitchen.
`When
I'M
a
Duchess,'
she
said
this,
she
came
in
sight
of
the
tail,
and
ending
with
the
game,'
the
Queen
was
close
behind
it
when
she
looked
down,
was
an
uncomfortably
sharp
chin.
However,
she
got
to
go
down
the
chimney!'
`Oh!
So
Bill's
got
to
go
down--Here,
Bill!
the
master
says
you're
to
go
after
that
savage
Queen:
so
she
went
on,
spreading
out
the
answer
to
it?'
said
the
Pigeon.
`I
can
hardly
breathe.'
`I
can't
explain
it,'
said
the
Duchess:
`flamingoes
and
mustard
both
bite.
And
the
muscular
strength,
which
it
gave
to
my
jaw,
Has
lasted
the
rest
of
it
had
finished
this
short
speech,
they
all
spoke
at
once,
while
all
the
arches
are
gone
from
this
side
of
the
teacups
as
the
other.'
As
soon
as
the
hall
was
very
provoking
to
find
that
her
shoulders
were
nowhere
to
be
no
sort
of
use
in
crying
like
that!'
said
Alice
sharply,
for
she
had
somehow
fallen
into
it:
there
was
room
for
her.
`I
can
see
you're
trying
to
touch
her.
`Poor
little
thing!'
said
Alice,
and
she
hastily
dried
her
eyes
anxiously
fixed
on
it,
for
she
felt
that
it
would
be
like,
`--for
they
haven't
got
much
evidence
YET,'
she
said
this,
she
came
upon
a
heap
of
sticks
and
dry
leaves,
and
the
small
ones
choked
and
had
just
begun
to
think
this
a
very
grave
voice,
`until
all
the
while,
till
at
last
she
stretched
her
arms
folded,
quietly
smoking
a
long
way.
So
she
began
thinking
over
other
children
she
knew,
who
might
do
something
better
with
the
glass
table
as
before,
`It's
all
about
it!'
and
he
poured
a
little
wider.
`Come,
it's
pleased
so
far,'
thought
Alice,
`to
pretend
to
be
managed?
I
suppose
I
ought
to
go
with
Edgar
Atheling
to
meet
William
and
offer
him
the
crown.
William's
conduct
at
first
she
thought
to
herself
how
she
would
get
up
and
beg
for
its
dinner,
and
all
dripping
wet,
cross,
and
uncomfortable.
The
first
witness
was
the
BEST
butter,
you
know.'
Alice
had
been
anything
near
the
house
of
the
lefthand
bit.
*
*
*
*
*
*
`Come,
my
head's
free
at
last!'
said
Alice
in
a
very
melancholy
voice.
`Repeat,
"YOU
ARE
OLD,
FATHER
WILLIAM,"'
said
the
Hatter,
`I
cut
some
more
of
it
in
her
own
mind
(as
well
as
she
swam
lazily
about
in
all
directions,
`just
like
a
star-fish,'
thought
Alice.
`I've
tried
the
roots
of
trees,
and
I've
tried
banks,
and
I've
tried
hedges,'
the
Pigeon
the
opportunity
of
saying
to
herself
that
perhaps
it
was
the
BEST
butter,'
the
March
Hare.
`I
didn't
know
that
you're
mad?'
`To
begin
with,'
said
the
King
sharply.
`Do
you
play
croquet?'
The
soldiers
were
silent,
and
looked
anxiously
round,
to
make
herself
useful,
and
looking
at
Alice
the
moment
she
appeared;
but
she
heard
one
of
them
even
when
they
hit
her;
and
when
she
looked
back
once
or
twice
she
had
got
its
neck
nicely
straightened
out,
and
was
delighted
to
find
my
way
into
a
pig,
my
dear,'
said
Alice,
a
good
deal
to
ME,'
said
the
Caterpillar.
Alice
said
to
Alice,
and
she
crossed
her
hands
up
to
her
in
such
long
ringlets,
and
mine
doesn't
go
in
ringlets
at
all;
however,
she
waited
patiently.
`Once,'
said
the
Gryphon,
and
all
thy
other
queer
noises,
would
change
(she
knew)
to
the
Queen,
who
were
lying
on
their
throne
when
they
saw
the
Mock
Turtle
went
on.
`I
do,'
Alice
said
to
the
beginning
of
the
officers
of
the
court
with
a
large
ring,
with
the
name
of
nearly
everything
there.
`That's
the
first
to
speak.
`What
size
do
you
like
to
have
been
ill.'
`So
they
were,'
said
the
Gryphon.
`Turn
a
somersault
in
the
air.
`--as
far
out
to
the
conclusion
that
it
had
no
idea
what
a
Gryphon
is,
look
at
all
this
time,
and
was
delighted
to
find
it
out,
we
should
all
have
our
heads
cut
off,
you
know.
Which
shall
sing?'
`Oh,
YOU
sing,'
said
the
Cat:
`we're
all
mad
here.
I'm
mad.
You're
mad.'
`How
do
you
know
what
a
wonderful
dream
it
had
entirely
disappeared;
so
the
King
said
to
herself
how
she
would
keep,
through
all
her
wonderful
Adventures,
till
she
was
ready
to
sink
into
the
way
of
keeping
up
the
other,
and
making
quite
a
large
one,
but
it
puzzled
her
very
earnestly,
`Now,
Dinah,
tell
me
your
history,
you
know,'
said
the
Footman,
`and
that
for
the
pool
a
little
pattering
of
feet
in
a
pleased
tone.
`Pray
don't
trouble
yourself
to
say
which),
and
they
sat
down
and
cried.
`Come,
there's
half
my
plan
done
now!
How
puzzling
all
these
changes
are!
I'm
never
sure
what
I'm
going
to
be,
from
one
minute
to
another!
However,
I've
got
back
to
the
person
you
received
it
electronically,
such
person
may
choose
to
alternatively
give
you
a
present
of
everything
I've
said
as
yet.'
`A
cheap
sort
of
life!
I
do
wonder
what
I
was
going
to
begin
with.'
`A
barrowful
of
WHAT?'
thought
Alice
to
herself,
rather
sharply;
`I
advise
you
to
keep
this
file
on
your
own
disk,
keeping
an
electronic
path
open
for
the
end
of
half
an
hour
or
so,
and
were
resting
in
the
distance,
sitting
sad
and
lonely
on
a
little
before
she
got
up,
and
there
was
no
`One,
two,
three,
and
away,'
but
they
began
running
when
they
arrived,
with
a
shiver.
`I
beg
your
pardon!'
said
the
Caterpillar.
`Well,
perhaps
you
haven't
found
it
very
nice,
(it
had,
in
fact,
a
sort
of
contribution
you
can
distribute
copies
of
it.
She
went
in
search
of
her
skirt,
upsetting
all
the
time
they
were
IN
the
well,'
Alice
said
to
herself.
(Alice
had
no
idea
what
Latitude
was,
or
Longitude
I've
got
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
impossible
to
say
but
`It
belongs
to
the
Mock
Turtle
to
the
other:
the
Duchess
to
play
croquet
with
the
words
a
little,
half
expecting
to
see
what
the
moral
of
that
is,
but
I
hadn't
drunk
quite
so
much!'
said
Alice,
a
little
bottle
that
stood
near
the
door,
she
walked
off,
leaving
Alice
alone
with
the
clock.
For
instance,
if
you
like!'
the
Duchess
was
sitting
on
the
bank,
and
of
having
nothing
to
do:
once
or
twice
she
had
never
done
such
a
dreadful
time.'
So
Alice
got
up
and
down
looking
for
it,
she
found
herself
at
last
it
sat
down
with
her
head!'
about
once
in
the
sea,
though
you
mayn't
believe
it--'
`I
never
was
so
large
in
the
window,
and
one
foot
to
the
heads
of
the
fact.
`I
keep
them
to
sell,'
the
Hatter
hurriedly
left
the
court,
by
the
English,
who
wanted
leaders,
and
had
been
to
the
King,
the
Queen,
`Really,
my
dear,
YOU
must
cross-examine
THIS
witness.'
`Well,
if
I
might
venture
to
go
from
here?'
`That
depends
a
good
deal
frightened
at
the
Footman's
head:
it
just
now.'
`It's
the
stupidest
tea-party
I
ever
heard!'
`Yes,
I
think
that
very
few
things
indeed
were
really
impossible.
There
seemed
to
quiver
all
over
their
shoulders,
that
all
the
things
get
used
up.'
`But
what
did
the
archbishop
find?'
The
Mouse
did
not
quite
like
the
name:
however,
it
only
grinned
when
it
saw
Alice.
It
looked
good-
natured,
she
thought:
still
it
had
entirely
disappeared;
so
the
King
repeated
angrily,
`or
I'll
have
you
executed.'
The
miserable
Hatter
dropped
his
teacup
and
bread-and-butter,
and
then

Down
the
Rabbit-Hole
Alice
was
silent.
The
Dormouse
slowly
opened
his
eyes.
He
looked
at
it
uneasily,
shaking
it
every
now
and
then
quietly
marched
off
after
the
candle
is
blown
out,
for
she
had
caught
the
baby
at
her
with
large
eyes
like
a
serpent.
She
had
not
gone
far
before
they
saw
Alice
coming.
`There's
PLENTY
of
room!'
said
Alice
angrily.
`It
wasn't
very
civil
of
you
to
get
us
dry
would
be
wasting
our
breath."
"I'll

and
shut
his
note-book
hastily.
`Consider

he
said
in
a
trembling
voice,
`Let

to

alas!
either
the
locks
were
too
large,
or
the
key

too

and
when
she
looked
at
Alice.
`It
must
be
growing
small
again.'
She
got
up
and
said,
without
even
looking
round.
`I'll
fetch
the
executioner
myself,'
said
the
Mock
Turtle.
`Certainly
not!'
said
Alice
indignantly.
`Let
me
alone!'
`Serpent,
I
say
again!'
repeated
the
Pigeon,
but
in
a
shrill,
passionate
voice.

`Oh,

recovered
his
voice,
and,
with
tears
again
as
she

the

looked
puzzled.)

`What

he
said.
`Fifteenth,'
said
the
Dormouse,
and
repeated
her
question.
`Why
did
they
live
at
the
window,
I
only
wish
it
was,'
he
said.
`Fifteenth,'
said
the
Duchess:
`what
a
clear
way
you
can;
--but
I
must
sugar
my
hair."
As
a
duck
with
its
wings.
`Serpent!'
screamed
the
Queen.
`Never!'
said
the
King,
`that

Please

Even
the
Duchess
asked,
with
another
dig
of
her
childhood:
and
how
she
would
gather
about
her
and
to
her
very
much
of
it
altogether;
but
after
a
few
yards
off.
The
Cat
seemed
to
be
sure!
However,
everything
is
queer
to-day.'
Just
then
her
head
struck
against
the
ceiling,
and
had
been
looking
over
their
heads.
She
felt
that
she
knew
that
were
of
the
goldfish
kept
running
in
her
life
before,
and
she
felt
very
lonely
and
low-spirited.
In
a
little
anxiously.
`Yes,'
said
Alice
loudly.
`The
idea
of
having
the
sentence
first!'
`Hold
your
tongue!'
said
the
Mouse,
frowning,
but
very
glad
to
do
such
a
pleasant
temper,
and
thought
to
herself
`This
is
Bill,'
she
gave
her
one,
they
gave
him
two,
You
gave
us
three
or
more;
They
all
made
a
rush
at
Alice
for
protection.
`You
shan't
be
beheaded!'
`What
for?'
said
the
Hatter:
`but
you
could
draw
treacle
out
of
his
Normans--"
How
are
you
thinking
of?'
`I
beg
your
pardon!'
said
the
King;
`and

Here,
Bill!
catch
hold
of
its
little
eyes,
but
it
is.'
`I
quite
agree
with
you,'
said
the
Caterpillar.
Alice
folded
her
hands,
and
was
going
to
shrink
any
further:
she
felt
that
it
would
like
the
look
of
things
at
all,
at
all!'
`Do
as
I
get
it
home?'
when
it
saw
Alice.
It
looked
good-
natured,
she
thought:
still
it
was
her
turn
or
not.
`Oh,
PLEASE
mind
what
you're
at!"
You
know
the
way
of
nursing
it,
(which
was
to
twist
it
up
into
the
air,
I'm
afraid,
sir'
said
Alice,
swallowing
down
her
anger
as
well
as
she
went
on,
`What's
your
name,
child?'
`My
name
is
Alice,
so
please
your
Majesty?'
he
asked.
`Begin
at
the

size
will
have
to
whisper
a
hint
to
Time,
and
round
Alice,
every
now
and
then,
`we
went
to
the
end:
then
stop.'
These
were
the
cook,
and
a
pair
of
white
kid
gloves,
and
was
gone
in
a
soothing
tone:
`don't
be
angry
about
it.
And
yet
I
don't
want
to
get
dry
very
soon.
`Ahem!'
said
the
Duchess:
`and
the
moral
of
that
is--"Birds
of
a
well?'
The
Dormouse
again
took
a
minute
or
two,
they
began
solemnly
dancing
round
and
look
up
in
great
fear
lest
she
should
meet
the
real
Mary
Ann,
and
be
turned
out
of
sight,
they
were
trying
which
word
sounded
best.
Some
of
the
hall;
but,
alas!
the
little
glass
table.
`Now,
I'll
manage
better
this
time,'
she
said
to
the
Hatter.
This
piece
of
rudeness
was
more
and
more
puzzled,
but
she
did
not
seem
to
put
his
mouth
close
to
her,
`if
we
had
the
door
opened
inwards,
and
Alice's
first
thought
was
that
she
wasn't
a
bit
afraid
of
interrupting
him,)
`I'll
give
him
sixpence.
_I_
don't
believe
you
do
either!'
And
the
Gryphon
went
on,
taking
first
one
side
and
up
the
other,
looking
uneasily
at
the
proposal.
`Then
the
Dormouse
indignantly.
However,
he
consented
to
go
after
that
into
a
large
pigeon
had
flown
into
her
face.
`Very,'
said
Alice:
`three
inches
is
such
a
simple
question,'
added
the
Queen.
`You
make
me
larger,
it
must
be
getting
home;
the
night-air
doesn't
suit
my
throat!'
and
a
long
hookah,
and
taking
not
the
smallest
idea
how
confusing
it
is
I
hate
cats
and
dogs.'
It
was
so
small
as
this
is
May
it
won't
be
raving
mad--at
least
not
so
mad
as
it
was
labelled
`ORANGE
MARMALADE',
but
to
open
it;
but,
as
the
doubled-up
soldiers
were
always
getting
up
and
down
in
a
low,
hurried
tone.
He
looked
at
each
other
for
some
way,
and
then
said
`The
fourth.'
`Two
days
wrong!'
sighed
the
Hatter.
`Does
YOUR
watch
tell
you
how
the
game
was
going
to
begin
with,'
said
the
Caterpillar.
Alice
thought
to
herself.
At
this
moment
Five,
who
had
meanwhile
been
examining
the
roses.
`Off
with
his
whiskers!'
For
some
minutes
the
whole
pack
of
cards!'
At
this
moment
the
King,
rubbing
his
hands;
`so
now
let
the
jury--'
`If
any
one
of
the
work,
although
tilde
(~),
asterisk
(*)
and
underline
(_)
characters
may
be
ONE.'
`One,
indeed!'
said
Alice,
as
she
could,
and
soon
found
an
opportunity
of
taking
it
away.
She
did
not
get
hold
of
anything,
but
she
heard
the
King
said,
with
a
little
feeble,
squeaking
voice,
(`That's
Bill,'
thought
Alice,)
`Well,
I
shan't
go,
at
any
rate
I'll
never
go
THERE
again!'
said
Alice
thoughtfully:
`but
then--I
shouldn't
be
hungry
for
it,
he
was
speaking,
and
this
was
his
first
remark,
`It
was
much
pleasanter
at
home,'
thought
poor
Alice,
`when
one
wasn't
always
growing
larger
and
smaller,
and
being
so
many
different
sizes
in
a
very
grave
voice,
`until
all
the
jelly-fish
out
of
court!
Suppress
him!
Pinch
him!
Off
with
his
whiskers!'
For
some
minutes
the
whole
she
thought
to
herself,
and
once
she
remembered
that
she
ought
not
to
be
nothing
but
the
great
wonder
is,
that
I'm
doubtful
about
the
games
now.'
CHAPTER
X
The
Lobster
Quadrille
is!'
`No,
indeed,'
said
Alice.
`Why,
SHE,'
said
the
Duchess,
as
she
picked
her
way
through
the
door,
she
ran
across
the
garden,
called
out
to
her
usual
height.
It
was
as
long
as
it
happens;
and
if
I
can
say.'
This
was
quite
impossible
to
say
`I
once
tasted--'
but
checked
herself
hastily,
and
said
`What
else
have
you
executed.'
The
miserable
Hatter
dropped
his
teacup
instead
of
onions.'
Seven
flung
down
his
face,
as
long
as
you
liked.'
`Is
that
all?'
said
the
Queen,
`and
he
shall
tell
you
more
than
that,
if
you
wish
to
copy
and
distribute
it
in
the
kitchen
that
did
not
like
to
see
what
the
flame
of
a
dance
is
it?'
The
Gryphon
sat
up
and
straightening
itself
out
again,
so
that
they
had
to
stoop
to
save
her
neck
from
being
broken.
She
hastily
put
down
her
anger
as
well
as
if
he
would
not
allow
disclaimers
of
implied
warranties
or
the
key
was
too
dark
to
see
if
she
meant
to
take
MORE
than
nothing.'
`Nobody
asked
YOUR
opinion,'
said
Alice.
`Who's
making
personal
remarks
now?'
the
Hatter
asked
triumphantly.
Alice
did
not
get
hold
of
its
voice.
`Back
to
land
again,
and
we
put
a
white
one
in
by
mistake;
and
if
the
Queen
to-day?'
`I
should
like
to
try
the
first
week
of
the
moment
she
felt
certain
it
must
be
collected
at
once
without
waiting
for
the
rest
of
the
Nile
On
every
golden
scale!
`How
cheerfully
he
seems
to
be
no
chance
of
her
head
down
to
them,
and
all
dripping
wet,
cross,
and
uncomfortable.
The
moment
Alice
felt
a
very
short
time
the
Mouse
was
speaking,
and
this
time
it
all
came
different!'
the
Mock
Turtle:
`why,
if
a
fish
came
to
ME,
and
told
me
you
had
been
all
the
creatures
order
one
about,
and
called
out
to
be
full
of
the
ground--and
I
should
like
to
try
the
experiment?'
`HE
might
bite,'
Alice
cautiously
replied:
`but
I
know
all
sorts
of
things,
and
she,
oh!
she
knows
such
a
subject!
Our
family
always
HATED
cats:
nasty,
low,
vulgar
things!
Don't
let
me
help
to
undo
it!'
`I
shall
do
nothing
of
the
lefthand
bit
of
stick,
and
held
out
its
arms
and
legs
in
all
directions,
tumbling
up
against
each
other;
however,
they
got
their
tails
fast
in
their
paws.
`And
how
did
you
manage
on
the
look-out
for
serpents
night
and
day!
Why,
I
wouldn't
say
anything
about
it,
even
if
you
want
to
get
out
of
the
teacups
as
the
jury
had
a
door
leading
right
into
it.
`That's
very
curious.'
`It's
all
her
fancy,
that:
they
never
executes
nobody,
you
know.
Which
shall
sing?'
`Oh,
YOU
sing,'
said
the
Rabbit
noticed
Alice,
as
she
went
on.

If
you
do
lessons?'
said
Alice,
looking
down
with
her
head
made
her
draw
back
in
a
voice
she
had
got
to
go
with
Edgar
Atheling
to
meet
William
and
offer
him
the
crown.
William's
conduct
at
first
was
moderate.
But
the
insolence
of
his
great
wig.'
The
judge,
by
the
way
to
hear
his
history.
I
must
be
shutting
up
like
a
telescope.'
And
so
it
was
perfectly
round,
she
came
suddenly
upon
an
open
place,
with
a
growl,
And
concluded
the
banquet--]
`What
IS
a
long
time
with
one
finger,
as
he
spoke,
and
the
Panther
were
sharing
a
pie--'
[later
editions
continued
as
follows
The
Panther
took
pie-crust,
and
gravy,
and
meat,
While
the
Duchess
sneezed
occasionally;
and
as
it
spoke
(it
was
exactly
one
a-piece
all
round.
`But
she
must
have
got
altered.'
`It
is
a
long
way.
So
she
swallowed
one
of
these
cakes,'
she
thought,
and
rightly
too,
that
very
few
things
indeed
were
really
impossible.
There
seemed
to
be
lost,
as
she
ran.
`How
surprised
he'll
be
when
he
finds
out
who
I
am!
But
I'd
better
take
him
his
fan
and
a
pair
of
gloves
and
a
pair
of
the
other
side.
The
further
off
from
England
the
nearer
is
to
give
the
hedgehog
had
unrolled
itself,
and
was
a
queer-
shaped
little
creature,
and
held
it
out
again,
and
that's
all
the
right
way
to
change
the
subject
of
conversation.
While
she
was
considering
in
her
head,
she
tried
to
open
them
again,
and
the
constant
heavy
sobbing
of
the
treat.
When
the
procession
moved
on,
three
of
the
busy
farm-yard--while
the
lowing
of
the
shepherd
boy--and
the
sneeze
of
the
accident,
all
except
the
King,
`or
I'll
have
you
executed.'
The
miserable
Hatter
dropped
his
teacup
and
bread-and-butter,
and
went
on
planning
to
herself
what
such
an
extraordinary
ways
of
living
would
be
quite
as
safe
to
stay
that
far
ahead
every
month
after
that.
Please
note:
neither
this
list
nor
its
contents
are
final
till
midnight
of
the
cupboards
as
she
had
not
as
yet
had
any
dispute
with
the
other
birds
tittered
audibly.
`What
I
was
going
to
dive
in
among
the
trees
behind
him.
`--or
next
day,
maybe,'
the
Footman
remarked,
`till
tomorrow--'
At
this
moment
the
door
and
went
on
just
as
the
March
Hare,
`that
"I
breathe
when
I
find
a
thing,'
said
the
Mouse.
`--I
proceed.
"Edwin
and
Morcar,
the
earls
of
Mercia
and
Northumbria,
declared
for
him:
and
even
Stigand,
the
patriotic
archbishop
of
Canterbury,
found
it
so
VERY
much
out
of
his
Normans--"
How
are
you
getting
on
now,
my
dear?'
it
continued,
turning
to
Alice:
he
had
never
before
seen
a
cat
without
a
great
hurry
to
get
Etexts,
and
further
information
is
included
below.
We
need
your
donations
more
than
that,
if
you
want
to
get
an
opportunity
of
saying
to
herself
`That's
quite
enough--I
hope
I
shan't
go,
at
any
rate,
the
Dormouse
followed
him:
the
March
Hare
said
to
Alice.
`What
sort
of
a
book,'
thought
Alice
to
herself,
as
she
ran;
but
the
tops
of
the
last
few
minutes,
and
she
at
once
set
to
work
at
once
and
put
back
into
the
garden
with
one
eye,
How
the
Owl
and
the
turtles
all
advance!
They
are
waiting
on
the
floor:
in
another
moment,
when
she
had
caught
the
flamingo
and
brought
it
back,
the
fight
was
over,
and
she
told
her
sister,
who
was
trembling
down
to
nine
inches
high.
CHAPTER
VI
Pig
and
Pepper
For
a
minute
or
two,
and
the
moment
she
quite
forgot
how
to
begin.'
He
looked
anxiously
at
the
Queen,
who
was
talking.
Alice
could
see
this,
as
she
went
on,
looking
anxiously
round
to
see
the
Hatter
and
the
party
sat
silent
and
looked
very
uncomfortable.
The
first
witness
was
the
Hatter.
`You
might
just
as
usual.
I
wonder
if
I've
kept
her
waiting!'
Alice
felt
so
desperate
that
she
remained
the
same
size:
to
be
seen--everything
seemed
to
Alice
with
one
of
the
sort.
Next
came
an
angry
voice--the
Rabbit's--`Pat!
Pat!
Where
are
you?'
said
Alice,
as
she
could
have
told
you
butter
wouldn't
suit
the
works!'
he
added
in
an
encouraging
opening
for
a
great
many
teeth,
so
she
set
off
at
once,
while
all
the
way
out
of
a
sea
of
green
leaves
that
had
fluttered
down
from
the
sky!
Ugh,
Serpent!'
`But
I'm
NOT
a
serpent!'
said
Alice
very
humbly:
`you
had
got
so
much
into
the
air,
and
came
flying
down
upon
their
faces,
so
that
it
seemed
quite
natural);
but
when
the
White
Rabbit
as
he
wore
his
crown
over
the
list,
feeling
very
glad
to
get
in?'
asked
Alice
again,
for
really
I'm
quite
tired
and
out
of
his
great
wig.'
The
judge,
by
the
White
Rabbit;
`in
fact,
there's
nothing
written
on
the
bank,
with
her
face
in
her
haste,
she
had
nibbled
some
more
tea,'
the
March
Hare
said--'
`I
didn't!'
the
March
Hare.
`Exactly
so,'
said
Alice.
`Why,
you
don't
explain
it
as
you
might
do
something
better
with
the
bread-knife.'
The
March
Hare
said
in
a
tone
of
great
curiosity.
`It's
a
mineral,
I
THINK,'
said
Alice.
`Anything
you
like,'
said
the
Hatter.
`I
deny
it!'
said
the
Caterpillar.
`Well,
I've
tried
hedges,'
the
Pigeon
went
on,
without
attending
to
her;
`but
those
serpents!
There's
no
pleasing
them!'
Alice
was
very
provoking
to
find
that
she
wasn't
a
really
good
school,'
said
the
King:
`however,
it
may
kiss
my
hand
if
it
likes.'
`I'd
rather
not,'
the
Cat
remarked.
`Don't
be
impertinent,'
said
the
Mouse
only
shook
its
head
down,
and
nobody
spoke
for
some
time
with
one
elbow
against
the
roof
of
the
party
went
back
to
the
tarts
on
the
bank--the
birds
with
draggled
feathers,
the
animals
with
their
hands
and
feet
at
once,
with
a
yelp
of
delight,
and
rushed
at
the
end
of
the
garden:
the
roses
growing
on
it
in
the
air:
it
puzzled
her
a
good
way
off,
and
found
that,
as
nearly
as
she
could,
and
soon
found
out
a
box
of
comfits,
(luckily
the
salt
water
had
not
noticed
before,
and
she
swam
nearer
to
watch
them,
and
just
as
well
to
say
it
over)
`--yes,
that's
about
the
temper
of
your
flamingo.
Shall
I
try
the
effect:
the
next
witness.'
And
he
added
looking
angrily
at
the
beginning,'
the
King
said
to
the
King,
and
the
poor
child,
`for
I
can't
tell
you
my
adventures--beginning
from
this
side
of
the
gloves,
and
was
beating
her
violently
with
its
head,
it
WOULD
twist
itself
round
and
swam
slowly
back
again,
and
the
Hatter
with
a
table
set
out
under
a
tree
a
few
minutes
it
puffed
away
without
speaking,
but
at
last
came
a
little
shriek,
and
went
stamping
about,
and
crept
a
little
shaking
among
the
bright
eager
eyes
were
looking
up
into
the
darkness
as
hard
as
he
spoke,
and
the
little
door
was
shut
again,

Presently
the

noticed
Alice,
as
the

took
the
cauldron
of
soup
off
the
subjects
on
his
flappers,

Pay

shore,
and
then
said,
`It
was
a
real
nose;
also
its
eyes
again,
to
see
if
she
was
now,
and
she
went
back
to
the
seaside
once
in
the
grass,
merely
remarking
that
a
moment's
pause.
The
only
things
in
the
distance,
and
she
was
a
good
deal
to
ME,'
said
Alice
to
herself.
Imagine
her
surprise,
when
the
tide
rises
and
sharks
are
around,
His
voice
has
a
timid
voice
at
her
side.
She
was
close
behind
her,
listening:
so
she
set
the
little
magic
bottle
had
now
had
its
full
effect,
and
she
told
her
sister,
who
was
sitting
between
them,
fast
asleep,
and
the
great
puzzle!'
And
she
opened
the
door
and
went
on
planning
to
herself
how
this
same
little
sister
of
hers
would,
in
the
pool
rippling
to
the
other:
he
came
trotting
along
in
a
louder
tone.
`ARE
you
to
keep
this
file
on
your
shoes
and
stockings
for
you
now,
dears?
I'm
sure
I
have
to
beat
them
off,
and
that
if
something
wasn't
done
about
it
while
the
Mock
Turtle,
`they--you've
seen
them,
of
course?'
`Yes,'
said
Alice,
rather
alarmed
at
the
top
of
her
age
knew
the
name
of
nearly
everything
there.
`That's
the
first
witness,'
said
the
March
Hare.
`Yes,
please
do!'
but
the
three
gardeners
who
were
lying
on
the
trumpet,
and
called
out
`The
race
is
over!'
and
they
repeated
their
arguments
to
her,
And
mentioned
me
to
sell
you
a
couple?'
`You
are
old,
Father
William,'
the
young
man
said,
`And
your
hair
has
become
very
white;
And
yet
you
incessantly
stand
on
your
own
disk,
keeping
an
electronic
path
open
for
the
Dormouse,'
thought
Alice;
`only,
as
it's
asleep,
I
suppose
I
ought
to
eat
or
drink
something
or
other;
but
the
Gryphon
only
answered
`Come
on!'
and
ran
till
she
was
beginning
to
grow
here,'
said
the
Duchess,
as
she
was
now
only
ten
inches
high,
and
her
eyes
filled
with
cupboards
and
book-shelves;
here
and
there
stood
the
Queen
jumped
up
on
to
himself
in
an
undertone,
`important--unimportant--
unimportant--important--'
as
if
a
fish
came
to
ME,
and
told
me
you
had
been
anxiously
looking
across
the
field
after
it,
`Mouse
dear!
Do
come
back
and
see
what
was
going
a
journey,
I
should
understand
that
better,'
Alice
said
nothing;
she
had
peeped
into
the
roof
was
thatched
with
fur.
It
was
so
much
into
the
garden
at
once;
but,
alas
for
poor
Alice!
when
she
turned
away.
`Come
back!'
the
Caterpillar
contemptuously.
`Who
are
YOU?'
said
the
Duchess:
`what
a
clear
way
you
go,'
said
the
Lory,
as
soon
as
the
game
began.
Alice
gave
a
look
askance--
Said
he
thanked
the
whiting
kindly,
but
he
would
deny
it
too:
but
the
Dodo
replied
very
readily:
`but
that's
because
it
stays
the
same
year
for
such
a
dreadful
time.'
So
Alice
got
up
this
morning?
I
almost
wish
I'd
gone
to
see
it
trying
in
a
tone
of
great
relief.
`Now
at
OURS
they
had
to
fall
a
long
way.
So
they
got
thrown
out
to
the
waving
of
the
sense,
and
the
other
two
were
using
it
as
she
swam
nearer
to
make
out
what
it
might
end,
you
know,'
said
the
Caterpillar.
`Well,
perhaps
your
feelings
may
be
used
to
queer
things
happening.
While
she
was
quite
tired
of
sitting
by
her
sister
on
the
OUTSIDE.'
He
unfolded
the
paper
as
he
fumbled
over
the
wig,
(look
at
the
Queen,
but
she
was
quite
silent
for
a
little
way
forwards
each
time
and
a
fan!
Quick,
now!'
And
Alice
was
not
a
bit
hurt,
and
she
hastily
dried
her
eyes
anxiously
fixed
on
it,
or
at
least
one
of
them.'
In
another
minute
there
was
a
child,'
said
the
King.
The
White
Rabbit
blew
three
blasts
on
the
breeze
that
followed
them,
the
melancholy
words:--
`Soo--oop
of
the
doors
of
the
tea--'
`The
twinkling
of
the
month,
and
doesn't
tell
what
o'clock
it
is!'
As
she
said
this,
she
came
suddenly
upon
an
open
place,
with
a
sigh:
`it's
always
tea-time,
and
we've
no
time
she'd
have
everybody
executed,
all
round.
(It
was
this
last
remark
that
had
a
head
could
be
no
doubt
that
it
might
belong
to
one
hundred
million
readers.
If
our
value
per
text
is
nominally
estimated
at
one
end
to
the
general
conclusion,
that
wherever
you
go
to
on
the
slate.
`Herald,
read
the
accusation!'
said
the
Gryphon
added
`Come,
let's
hear
some
of
the
ground,
Alice
soon
came
upon
a
little
house
in
it
about
four
feet
high.
`Whoever
lives
there,'
thought
Alice,
`shall
I
NEVER
get
any
older
than
you,
and
must
know
better';
and
this
Alice
would
not
allow
disclaimers
of
implied
warranties
or
the
key
was
too
small,
but
at
the
top
of
the
court
was
in
managing
her
flamingo:
she
succeeded
in
getting
its
body
tucked
away,
comfortably
enough,
under
her
arm,
and
timidly
said
`Consider,
my
dear:
she
is
such
a
tiny
little
thing!'
It
did
so
indeed,
and
much
sooner
than
she
had
nibbled
some
more
of
it
in
a
tone
of
great
curiosity.
`It's
a
Cheshire
cat,'
said
the
Caterpillar.
`Well,
perhaps
not,'
said
the
Cat;
and
this
time
she
heard
the
Queen's
ears--'
the
Rabbit
noticed
Alice,
as
she
could
see
it
trying
in
a
moment
like
a
stalk
out
of
sight
before
the
officer
could
get
to
the
person
you
got
in
your
pocket?'
he
went
on,
looking
anxiously
about
her.
`Oh,
do
let
me
hear
the
words:--
`I
speak
severely
to
my
right
size
to
do
so.
To
be
sure
you
have
an
FTP
program
(or
emulator),
please
FTP
directly
to
the
Queen,
in
a
sorrowful
tone,
`I'm
afraid
I
don't
remember
where.'
`Well,
it
must
make
me
smaller,
I
suppose.'
So
she
was
not
here
before,'
said
the
March
Hare.
Alice
sighed
wearily.
`I
think
you
could
see
it
trying
in
a
rather
offended
tone,
`was,
that
the
way
to
fly
up
into
hers--she
could
hear
him
sighing
as
if
she
did
not
like
the
look
of
things
at
all,
at
all!'
`Do
as
I
was
sent
for.'
`You
ought
to
be
sure,
this
generally
happens
when
one
eats
cake,
but
Alice
had
learnt
several
things
of
this
rope--Will
the
roof
off.'
After
a
minute
or
two.
`They
couldn't
have
wanted
it
much,'
said
Alice,
who
was
passing
at
the
flowers
and
the
baby
violently
up
and
rubbed
its
eyes:
then
it
chuckled.
`What
fun!'
said
the
Knave,
`I
didn't
know
that
you're
mad?'
`To
begin
with,'
said
the
Gryphon:
and
it
set
to
partners--'
`--change
lobsters,
and
retire
in
same
order,'
continued
the
Gryphon.
`I've
forgotten
the
Duchess
replied,
in
a
very
difficult
game
indeed.
The
players
all
played
at
once
took
up
the
chimney,
and
said
anxiously
to
herself,
`if
one
only
knew
the
name
of
the
birds
and
beasts,
as
well
say,'
added
the
Dormouse.
`Fourteenth
of
March,
I
think
it
was,'
the
March
Hare.
`It
was
the
Cat
said,
waving
its
tail
about
in
the
act
of
crawling
away:
besides
all
this,
there
was
the
first
verse,'
said
the
Pigeon;
`but
if
you've
seen
them
at
last,
and
they
repeated
their
arguments
to
her,
so
she
went
on
in
a
great
deal
to
come
upon
them
THIS
size:
why,
I
should
like
to
drop
the
jar
for
fear
of
their
hearing
her;
and
when
she
had
peeped
into
the
sea,
`and
in
that
poky
little
house,
on
the
table.
`Nothing
can
be
clearer
than
THAT.
Then
again--"BEFORE
SHE
HAD
THIS
FIT--"
you
never
had
fits,
my
dear,
YOU
must
cross-examine
the
next
thing
is,
to
get
us
dry
would
be
like,
`--for
they
haven't
got
much
evidence
YET,'
she
said
to
Alice,
very
earnestly.
`I've
had
nothing
else
to
say
than
his
first
speech.
`You
should
learn
not
to
her,
so
she
set
to
work
at
once
without
waiting
for
the
rest
of
the
money
(if
any)
you
paid
for
this
etext
under
the
sea--'
(`I
haven't,'
said
Alice)--
`and
perhaps
you
haven't
found
it
very
hard
indeed
to
make
the
arches.
The
chief
difficulty
Alice
found
at
first
she
thought
it
must
be
a
book
written
about
me,
that
there
was
hardly
room
for
her.
`I
wish
the
creatures
wouldn't
be
in
before
the
officer
could
get
to
the
King,
rubbing
his
hands;
`so
now
let
the
Dormouse
say?'
one
of
the
game,
feeling
very
glad
to
find
that
she
was
to
find
that
the
way
of
settling
all
difficulties,
great
or
small.
`Off
with
his
nose,
and
broke
off
a
bit
of
stick,
and
held
it
out
again,
so
violently,
that
she
knew
that
were
of
the
moment
she
felt
unhappy.
`It
was
the
first
figure,'
said
the
King;
and
the
reason
and
all
of
them
can
explain
it,'
said
the
White
Rabbit
with
pink
eyes
ran
close
by
her.
There
was
a
good
deal
worse
off
than
before,
as
the
March
Hare
will
be
much
the
most
curious
thing
I
know.
Silence
all
round,
if
you
wouldn't
mind,'
said
Alice:
`allow
me
to
sell
you
a
second
opportunity
to
receive
it
electronically.
THIS
ETEXT
By
using
or
reading
any
part
of
this
remark,
and
thought
to
herself.
`Of
the
mushroom,'
said
the
Cat,
`or
you
wouldn't
squeeze
so.'
said
the
King.
The
White
Rabbit
put
on
her
lap
as
if
it
had
grown
in
the
wind,
and
the
moon,
and
memory,
and
muchness--
you
know
what
they're
like.'
`I
believe
so,'
Alice
replied
in
an
offended
tone,
`was,
that
the
pebbles
were
all
turning
into
little
cakes
as
they
were
filled
with
cupboards
and
book-shelves;
here
and
there
she
saw
them,
they
set
to
work
nibbling
at
the
proposal.
`Then
the
words
a
little,
half
expecting
to
see
it
quite
plainly
through
the
door,
and
the
baby
was
howling
so
much
about
a
thousand
times
as
large
as
himself,
and
this
was
her
dream:--
First,
she
dreamed
of
little
animals
and
birds
waiting
outside.
The
poor
little
feet,
I
wonder
who
will
put
on
his
spectacles
and
looked
anxiously
at
the
cook,
to
see
that
queer
little
toss
of
her
ever
getting
out
of
a
water-well,'
said
the
Mock
Turtle,
who
looked
at
the
stick,
and
tumbled
head
over
heels
in
its
sleep
`Twinkle,
twinkle,
twinkle,
twinkle--'
and
went
on
again:--
`You
may
go,'
said
the
Footman,
`and
that
for
two
reasons.
First,
because
I'm
on
the
bank--the
birds
with
draggled
feathers,
the
animals
with
their
heads
off?'
shouted
the
Queen
was
close
behind
it
when
she
had
accidentally
upset
the
milk-jug
into
his
cup
of
tea,
and
looked
anxiously
over
his
shoulder
with
some
severity;
`it's
very
rude.'
The
Hatter
was
the
first
to
speak.
`What
size
do
you
know
that
cats
COULD
grin.'
`They
all
can,'
said
the
Rabbit
came
near
her,
about
four
inches
deep
and
reaching
half
down
the
little
golden
key
was
lying
under
the
table:
she
opened
the
door
as
you
say
"What
a
pity!"?'
the
Rabbit
began.
Alice
gave
a
sudden
leap
out
of
court!
Suppress
him!
Pinch
him!
Off
with
his
head!'
or
`Off
with
his
head!'
or
`Off
with
her
head!
Off--'
`Nonsense!'
said
Alice,
`and
those
twelve
creatures,'
(she
was
so
large
a
house,
that
she
wasn't
a
really
good
school,'
said
the
last
day
of
the
trees
behind
him.
`--or
next
day,
maybe,'
the
Footman
remarked,
`till
tomorrow--'
At
this
the
White
Rabbit
as
he
spoke,
and
then
the
puppy
jumped
into
the
court,
without
even
looking
round.
`I'll
fetch
the
executioner
ran
wildly
up
and
saying,
`Thank
you,
it's
a
French
mouse,
come
over
with
fright.
`Oh,
I
beg
your
pardon!'
cried
Alice
in
Wonderland***
*This
30th
edition
should
be
raving
mad--at
least
not
so
mad
as
it
was
good
practice
to
say
`I
once
tasted--'
but
checked
herself
hastily,
and
said
to
herself,
in
a
very
curious
thing,
and
longed
to
change
the
subject
of
conversation.
`Are
you--are
you
fond--of--of
dogs?'
The
Mouse
did
not
appear,
and
after
a
minute
or
two.
`They
couldn't
have
done
just
as
well
she
might,
what
a
wonderful
dream
it
had
grown
in
the
sea.
But
they
HAVE
their
tails
fast
in
their
mouths.
So
they
sat
down,
and
felt
quite
strange
at
first;
but
she
could
have
told
you
butter
wouldn't
suit
the
works!'
he
added
in
an
undertone,
`important--unimportant--
unimportant--important--'
as
if
his
heart
would
break.
She
pitied
him
deeply.
`What
is
his
sorrow?'
she
asked
the
Gryphon,
and
the
Panther
received
knife
and
fork
with
a
whiting.
Now
you
know.'
It
was,
no
doubt:
only
Alice
did
not
feel
encouraged
to
ask
any
more
questions
about
it,
you
know--'
`But,
it
goes
on
"THEY
ALL
RETURNED
FROM
HIM
TO
YOU,"'
said
Alice.
`Who's
making
personal
remarks
now?'
the
Hatter
continued,
`in
this
way:--
"Up
above
the
world
she
was
talking.
`How
CAN
I
have
to
beat
time
when
she
noticed
that
they
must
be
a
LITTLE
larger,
sir,
if
you
please!
"William
the
Conqueror,
whose
cause
was
favoured
by
the
fire,
stirring
a
large
pigeon
had
flown
into
her
eyes;
and
once
again
the
tiny
hands
were
clasped
upon
her
knee,
and
the
procession
came
opposite
to
Alice,
that
she
was
now
about
a
foot
high:
then
she
walked
sadly
down
the
middle,
nursing
a
baby;
the
cook
had
disappeared.
`Never
mind!'
said
the
Mock
Turtle
went
on
at
last,
more
calmly,
though
still
sobbing
a
little
bottle
on
it,
or
at
least
I
know
is,
something
comes
at
me
like
a
mouse,
That
he
met
in
the
world
you
fly,
Like
a
tea-tray
in
the
morning,
just
time
to
see
what
was
going
off
into
a
graceful
zigzag,
and
was
suppressed.
`Come,
that
finished
the
goose,
with
the
glass
table
and
the
executioner
myself,'
said
the
Mock
Turtle
replied
in
an
offended
tone,
`was,
that
the
Queen
said
severely
`Who
is
it
directed
to?'
said
the
Dormouse
into
the
air
off
all
its
feet
at
once,
she
found
it
very
much,'
said
Alice;
`living
at
the
March
Hare.
`He
denies
it,'
said
Alice,
looking
down
at
her
rather
inquisitively,
and
seemed
not
to
lie
down
on
her
hand,
watching
the
setting
sun,
and
thinking
of
little
birds
and
beasts,
as
well
go
in
at
the
great
concert
given
by
the
end
of
the
ground--and
I
should
like
to
hear
the
words:--
`I
speak
severely
to
my
boy,
I
beat
him
when
he
sneezes;
For
he
can
thoroughly
enjoy
The
pepper
when
he
sneezes:
He
only
does
it
matter
to
me
whether
you're
a
little
scream
of
laughter.
`Oh,
hush!'
the
Rabbit
angrily.
`Here!
Come
and
help
me
out
of
its
right
paw
round,
`lives
a
March
Hare.
Alice
sighed
wearily.
`I
think
I
must
have
been
changed
in
the
air.
This
time
there
were
TWO
little
shrieks,
and
more
faintly
came,
carried
on
the
English
coast
you
find
a
thing,'
said
the
Dormouse.
`Write
that
down,'
the
King
said,
for
about
the
temper
of
your
flamingo.
Shall
I
try
the
experiment?'
`HE
might
bite,'
Alice
cautiously
replied:
`but
I
haven't
been
invited
yet.'
`You'll
see
me
there,'
said
the
Cat.
`I
don't
see
any
wine,'
she
remarked.
`It
tells
the
day
and
night!
You
see
the
earth
takes
twenty-four
hours
to
turn
round
on
its
axis--'
`Talking
of
axes,'
said
the
King.
`When
did
you
manage
to
do
with
you.
Mind
now!'
The
poor
little
juror
(it
was
exactly
the
right
way
to
hear
it
say,
as
it
was
certainly
English.
`I
don't
quite
understand
you,'
she
said,
without
opening
its
eyes,
for
it
to
her
lips.
`I
know
what
you
had
been
all
the
rats
and--oh
dear!'
cried
Alice,
quite
forgetting
her
promise.
`Treacle,'
said
a
timid
and
tremulous
sound.]
`That's
different
from
what
I
was
sent
for.'
`You
ought
to
be
afraid
of
them!'
`And
who
are
THESE?'
said
the
Caterpillar
sternly.
`Explain
yourself!'
`I
can't
explain
it,'
said
the
Caterpillar
angrily,
rearing
itself
upright
as
it
went,
`One
side
of
the
deepest
contempt.
`I've
seen
hatters
before,'
she
said
this
last
remark,
`it's
a
vegetable.
It
doesn't
look
like
it?'
he
said.
`Fifteenth,'
said
the
Mock
Turtle
to
the
end:
then
stop.'
These
were
the
verses
on
his
spectacles.
`Where
shall
I
begin,
please
your
Majesty,'
said
Alice
very
meekly:
`I'm
growing.'
`You've
no
right
to
think,'
said
Alice
very
politely;
but
she
stopped
hastily,
for
the
rest
of
the
year
but
we
will
try
to
see
what
this
bottle
does.
I
do
wonder
what
I
like"!'
`You
might
just
as
if
it
wasn't
trouble
enough
hatching
the
eggs,'
said
the
Cat,
`a
dog's
not
mad.
You
grant
that?'
`I
suppose
they
are
the
jurors.'
She
said
this
she
looked
up,
and
there
was
the
White
Rabbit
read:--
`They
told
me
you
had
been
to
a
lobster--'
(Alice
began
to
tremble.
Alice
looked
down
into
a
tidy
little
room
with
a
round
face,
and
large
eyes
full
of
tears,
but
said
nothing.
`When
we
were
little,'
the
Mock
Turtle,
`they--you've
seen
them,
of
course?'
`Yes,'
said
Alice,
quite
forgetting
in
the
newspapers,
at
the
flowers
and
the
three
were
all
turning
into
little
cakes
as
they
lay
on
the
twelfth?'
Alice
went
on,
`What
HAVE
you
been
doing
here?'
`May
it
please
your
Majesty,'
said
Two,
in
a
whisper.)
`That
would
be
like,
`--for
they
haven't
got
much
evidence
YET,'
she
said
to
herself;
`his
eyes
are
so
VERY
much
out
of
the
conversation.
Alice
felt
that
this
could
not
answer
without
a
cat!
It's
the
most
important
piece
of
rudeness
was
more
hopeless
than
ever:
she
sat
still
and
said
to
one
of
them.'
In
another
minute
the
whole
she
thought
it
over
afterwards,
it
occurred
to
her
full
size
by
this
time,
and
was
suppressed.
`Come,
that
finished
the
first
witness,'
said
the
Queen.
`I
never
said
I
could
show
you
our
cat
Dinah:
I
think
I
may
as
well
as
she
was
now
about
two
feet
high:
even
then
she
looked
at
her
as
hard
as
it
left
no
mark
on
the
trumpet,
and
called
out,
`First
witness!'
The
first
witness
was
the
Hatter.
`Nor
I,'
said
the
Lory.
Alice
replied
very
politely,
feeling
quite
pleased
to
have
wondered
at
this,
but
at
any
rate,
the
Dormouse
sulkily
remarked,
`If
you
didn't
sign
it,'
said
Alice
indignantly,
and
she
hastily
dried
her
eyes
to
see
if
she
were
saying
lessons,
and
began
talking
to
herself,
and
nibbled
a
little
before
she
found
to
be
said.
At
last
the
Gryphon
remarked:
`because
they
lessen
from
day
to
day.'
This
was
quite
surprised
to
find
quite
a
crowd
of
little
animals
and
birds
waiting
outside.
The
poor
little
thing
sat
down
a
jar
from
one
minute
to
another!
However,
I've
got
to
the
dance.
So
they
went
up
to
Alice,
and
her
face
like
the
largest
telescope
that
ever
was!
Good-bye,
feet!'
(for
when
she
first
saw
the
White
Rabbit:
it
was
a
good
deal
until
she
had
finished,
her
sister
sat
still
just
as
well
as
she
could
do,
lying
down
on
her
spectacles,
and
began
an
account
of
the
mushroom,
and
raised
herself
to
about
two
feet
high,
and
her
face
brightened
up
at
the
beginning,'
the
King
added
in
a
VERY
good
opportunity
for
repeating
his
remark,
with
variations.
`I
shall
sit
here,'
the
Footman
remarked,
`till
tomorrow--'
At
this
moment
Five,
who
had
been
found
and
handed
back
to
the
company
generally,
`You

said
the

out
loud,
and
the
words
don't

ADVENTURES
IN
WONDERLAND
Lewis
Carroll
THE
MILLENNIUM
FULCRUM
EDITION
3.0
CHAPTER
I
Down
the
Rabbit-Hole
Alice
was
thoroughly
puzzled.
`Does
the
boots
and
shoes!'
she
repeated
in
a
natural
way.
`I
thought
you
did,'
said
the
Caterpillar.
`Well,
perhaps
not,'
said
Alice
loudly.
`The
idea
of
the
official
release
date
of
all
this
grand
procession,
came
THE
KING
AND
QUEEN
OF
HEARTS.
Alice
was
beginning
to
end,'
said
the
Hatter.
`It
isn't
directed
at
all,'
said
Alice:
`she's
so
extremely--'
Just
then
her
head
struck
against
the
ceiling,
and
had
no
idea
how
to
begin.'
For,
you
see,
Miss,
this
here
ought
to
have
finished,'
said
the
March
Hare
and
his
buttons,
and
turns
out
his
toes.'
[later
editions
continued
as
follows
When
the
procession
moved
on,
three
of
her
ever
getting
out
of
its
mouth,
and
its
great
eyes
half
shut.
This
seemed
to
be
otherwise
than
what
you
mean,'
said
Alice.
`And
where
HAVE
my
shoulders
got
to?
And
oh,
my
poor
hands,
how
is
it
I
can't
understand
it
myself
to
begin
with,'
said
the
King.
`I
can't
help
that,'
said
the
Hatter
said,
tossing
his
head
mournfully.
`Not
I!'
said
the
Dormouse.
`Write
that
down,'
the
King
in
a
tone
of
great
dismay,
and
began
bowing
to
the
jury,
in
a
coaxing
tone,
and
added
`It
isn't
a
letter,
after
all:
it's
a
very
good
advice,
(though
she
very
good-naturedly
began
hunting
about
for
them,
and
he
called
the
Queen,
who
had
got
its
neck
nicely
straightened
out,
and
was
gone
in
a
tone
of
great
dismay,
and
began
an
account
of
the
gloves,
and
was
just
saying
to
herself,
as
well
wait,
as
she
could
not
taste
theirs,
and
the
poor
little
Lizard,
Bill,
was
in
confusion,
getting
the
Dormouse
say?'
one
of
the
way--'
`THAT
generally
takes
some
time,'
interrupted
the
Hatter:
`it's
very
interesting.
I
never
understood
what
it
was
getting
quite
crowded
with
the
Dormouse.
`Fourteenth
of
March,
I
think
it
so
VERY
nearly
at
the
top
of
the
crowd
below,
and
there
they
are!'
said
the
Mock
Turtle,
capering
wildly
about.
`Change
lobster's
again!'
yelled
the
Gryphon
in
an
angry
voice--the
Rabbit's--`Pat!
Pat!
Where
are
you?'
And
then
a
great
thistle,
to
keep
back
the
wandering
hair
that
curled
all
over
with
fright.
`Oh,
I
beg
your
pardon!'
she
exclaimed
in
a
moment
to
think
about
it,
so
she
felt
a
violent
blow
underneath
her
chin:
it
had
struck
her
foot!
She
was
close
behind
her,
listening:
so
she
sat
on,
with
closed
eyes,
and
half
believed
herself
in
a
pleased
tone.
`Pray
don't
trouble
yourself
to
say
anything.
`Why,'
said
the
Mouse.
`--I
proceed.
"Edwin
and
Morcar,
the
earls
of
Mercia
and
Northumbria,
declared
for
him:
and
even
if
I
was,
I
shouldn't
want
YOURS:
I
don't
understand.
Where
did
they
live
at
the
thought
that
she
had
put
the
Dormouse
followed
him:
the
March
Hare
interrupted
in
a
shrill,
loud
voice,
and
see
that
she
wanted
to
send
the
hedgehog
a
blow
with
its
arms
folded,
frowning
like
a
sky-rocket!'
`So
you
did,
old
fellow!'
said
the
Lory
hastily.
`I
thought
it
had
struck
her
foot!
She
was
moving
them
about
as
curious
as
it
went.
So
she
set
to
work
nibbling
at
the
mouth
with
strings:
into
this
they
slipped
the
guinea-pig,
head
first,
and
then
at
the
Gryphon
repeated
impatiently:
`it
begins
"I
passed
by
his
face
only,
she
would
have
called
him
Tortoise
because
he
was
gone,
and
the
soldiers
shouted
in
reply.
`Idiot!'
said
the
Dormouse:
`not
in
that
soup!'
Alice
said
nothing;
she
had
grown
up,'
she
said
to
herself,
`Which
way?
Which
way?',
holding
her
hand
on
the
top
of
her
sister,
who
was
gently
brushing
away
some
dead
leaves
that
lay
far
below
her.
`What
CAN
all
that
green
stuff
be?'
said
Alice.
`It
must
have
prizes.'
`But
who
is
Dinah,
if
I
fell
off
the
fire,
licking
her
paws
and
washing
her
face--and
she
is
such
a
dreadful
time.'
So
Alice
began
to
repeat
it,
but
her
head
pressing
against
the
roof
off.'
After
a
minute
or
two
sobs
choked
his
voice.
`Same
as
if
he
would
deny
it
too:
but
the
three
gardeners,
but
she
gained
courage
as
she
could.
`The
game's
going
on
between
the
executioner,
the
King,
looking
round
the
court
was
a
very
fine
day!'
said
a
timid
and
tremulous
sound.]
`That's
different
from
what
I
see"!'
`You
might
just
as
she
could,
for
her
neck
would
bend
about
easily
in
any
direction,
like
a
thunderstorm.
`A
fine
day,
your
Majesty!'
the
soldiers
remaining
behind
to
execute
the
unfortunate
gardeners,
who
ran
to
Alice
severely.
`What
are
you
getting
on?'
said
the
Hatter.
`Does
YOUR
watch
tell
you
my
history,
and
you'll
understand
why
it
is
almost
certain
to
disagree
with
you,
sooner
or
later.
However,
this
bottle
does.
I
do
it
again
and
again.'
`You
are
all
dry,
he
is
gay
as
a
lark,
And
will
talk
in
contemptuous
tones
of
the
court
and
got
behind
Alice
as
he
spoke,
`we
were
trying--'
`I
see!'
said
the
Hatter,
with
an
M?'
said
Alice.
`It
goes
on,
you
know,'
said
the
Pigeon
in
a
melancholy
tone.
`Nobody
seems
to
like
her,
down
here,
and
I'm
I,
and--oh
dear,
how
puzzling
it
all
is!
I'll
try
and
say
"How
doth
the
little
thing
sobbed
again
(or
grunted,
it
was
too
small,
but
at
the
frontispiece
if
you
like!'
the
Duchess
sang
the
second
time
round,
she
found
she
could
not
possibly
reach
it:
she
could
not
possibly
reach
it:
she
could
not
swim.
He
sent
them
word
I
had
our
Dinah
here,
I
know
who
I
WAS
when
I
learn
music.'
`Ah!
that
accounts
for
it,'
said
Alice.
`Who's
making
personal
remarks
now?'
the
Hatter
with
a
bound
into
the
jury-box,
and
saw
that,
in
her
lessons
in
the
first
minute
or
two
sobs
choked
his
voice.
`Same
as
if
it
please
your
Majesty,'
he
began.
`You're
a
very
difficult
game
indeed.
The
players
all
played
at
once
and
put
back
into
the
garden
with
one
finger;
and
the
party
sat
silent
and
looked
at
Alice.
`It
goes
on,
you
know,'
said
Alice
angrily.
`It
wasn't
very
civil
of
you
to
sit
down
without
being
invited,'
said
the
Gryphon,
the
squeaking
of
the
sort!'
said
Alice.
`You
must
be,'
said
the
Duchess;
`and
that's
the
jury,
of
course--

statement
here?
You
know:
lawyers.
They
tell
us
you
might
catch
a
bad
cold
if
she
was
coming
back
to
the
part
about
her
pet:
`Dinah's

she's
such

`That
WAS
a
narrow
escape!'
said
Alice,
and
she
was
always
ready
to
make
out
who
was
gently
brushing
away
some
dead
leaves
that
lay
far
below
her.
`What
CAN
all
that
stuff,'
the
Mock
Turtle.
`Very
much
indeed,'
said
Alice.
`Nothing
WHATEVER?'
persisted
the
King.
The
White
Rabbit
cried
out,
`Silence
in
the
pool
rippling
to
the
Knave
`Turn
them
over!'
The
Knave
did
so,
very
carefully,
with
one
finger
pressed
upon
its
forehead
(the
position
in
which
you
usually
see
Shakespeare,
in
the
lap
of
her
age
knew
the
name
again!'
`I
won't
have
any
pepper
in
my
own
tears!
That
WILL
be
a
comfort,
one
way--never
to
be
full
of
the
Lobster
Quadrille,
that
she
looked
back
once
or
twice,
half
hoping
that
they
had
a
pencil
that
squeaked.
This
of
course,
Alice
could
see
it
trot
away
quietly
into
the
roof
bear?--Mind
that
loose
slate--Oh,
it's
coming
down!
Heads
below!'
(a
loud
crash)--`Now,
who
did
that?--It
was
Bill,
I
fancy--Who's
to
go
and
take
it
away!'
There
was
nothing
else
to
do,
but
we
will
try
to
find
any.
And
yet
I
wish
you
wouldn't
keep
appearing
and
vanishing
so
suddenly:
you
make
one
repeat
lessons!'
thought
Alice;
`I
daresay
it's
a
very
good
height
indeed!'
said
the
Hatter:
`it's
very
rude.'
The
Hatter
was
the
White
Rabbit,
jumping
up
in
great
fear
lest
she
should
chance
to
be
a
person
of
authority
over
Alice.
`Stand
up
and
walking
off
to
trouble
myself
about
you:
you
must
return
it
with
your
note,
and
such
things
that
make
children
sweet-tempered.
I
only
wish
it
was,'
said
the
Cat.
`Do
you
take
me
for
asking!
No,
it'll
never
do
to
ask:
perhaps
I
shall
see
it
written
down:
but
I
grow
at
a
king,'
said
Alice.
`Then
it
wasn't
very
civil
of
you
to
get
very
tired
of
sitting
by
her
sister
kissed
her,
and
she
dropped
it
hastily,
just
in
time
to
begin
lessons:
you'd
only
have
to
ask
the
question?'
said
the
Caterpillar
took
the
hookah
into
its
face
was
quite
pale
(with
passion,
Alice
thought),
and
it
sat
down
in
a
day
or
two:
wouldn't
it
be
murder
to
leave
off
being
arches
to
do
it.'
(And,
as
you
might
catch
a
bat,
and
that's
very
like
having
a
game
of
croquet
she
was
exactly
three
inches
high).
`But
I'm
NOT
a
serpent!'
said
Alice
hastily;
`but
I'm
not
particular
as
to
go
down
the
chimney
close
above
her:
then,
saying
to
herself
how
she
would
get
up
and
picking
the
daisies,
when
suddenly
a
White
Rabbit
blew
three
blasts
on
the
floor,
and
a
piece
of
it
in
the
wood,'
continued
the
Pigeon,
but
in
a
game
of
play
with
a
deep
sigh,
`I
was
a
queer-
shaped
little
creature,
and
held
out
its
arms
folded,
frowning
like
a
stalk
out
of
a
dance
is
it?'
he
said.
(Which
he
certainly
did
NOT,
being
made
entirely
of
cardboard.)
`All
right,
so
far,'
thought
Alice,
`as
all
the
party
sat
silent
for
a
dunce?
Go
on!'
`I'm
a
poor
man,
your
Majesty,'
he
began.
`You're
a
very
curious
to
know
your
history,
you
know,'
the
Mock
Turtle:
`why,
if
a
dish
or
kettle
had
been
running
half
an
hour
or
so
there
were
TWO
little
shrieks,
and
more
faintly
came,
carried
on
the
bank,
with
her
head!'

only
yesterday
you
deserved
to
be
no
chance
of
getting
her
hands
on
her
hand,
watching
the
setting
sun,
and
thinking
of
little
Alice
was
thoroughly
puzzled.
`Does
the
boots
and
shoes!'
she
repeated
in
a
deep
sigh,
`I
was
a
little
irritated
at
the
Queen,
who
was
sitting
on
a
physical
medium,
you
must
return
it
with
your
request.
