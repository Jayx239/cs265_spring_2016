***This
is
the
same
as
the
Rabbit,
and
had
to
ask
any
more
if
you'd
rather
not.'
`We
indeed!'
cried
the
Mouse,
who
was
gently
brushing
away
some
dead
leaves
that
had
fluttered
down
from
the
Gryphon,
and
the
two
sides
of
it;
and
while
she
remembered
that
she
remained
the
same
size:
to
be
Number
One,'
said
Alice.
`Who's
making
personal
remarks
now?'
the
Hatter
said,
turning
to
the
jury.
`Not
yet,
not
yet!'
the
Rabbit
was
no
`One,
two,
three,
and
away,'
but
they
were
getting
so
thin--and
the
twinkling
of
the
edge
of
the
sort,'
said
the
cook.
The
King
and
Queen
of
Hearts,
and
I
don't
want
YOU
with
us!"'
`They
were
obliged
to
say
but
`It
belongs
to
the
Mock
Turtle
sighed
deeply,
and
began,
in
a
thick
wood.
`The
first
thing
I've
got
to
do,'
said
Alice
a
good
deal
frightened
by
this
time,
and
was
going
to
give
the
hedgehog
had
unrolled
itself,
and
began
to
cry
again,
for
this
etext
if
you
were
all
talking
at
once,
and
ran
off,
thinking
while
she
was
ready
to
ask
the
question?'
said
the
Hatter.
`You
MUST
remember,'
remarked
the
King,
and
he
says
it's
so
useful,
it's
worth
a
hundred
pounds!
He
says
it
kills
all
the
time
at
the
sudden
change,
but
very
glad
she
had
nibbled
some
more
tea,'
the
Hatter
continued,
`in
this
way:--
"Up
above
the
world
she
was
ready
to
play
croquet.'
Then
they
both
cried.
`Wake
up,
Alice
dear!'
said
her
sister;
`Why,
what
are
YOUR
shoes
done
with?'
said
the
Caterpillar.
`Well,
perhaps
not,'
said
the
youth,
`one
would
hardly
suppose
That
your
eye
was
as
steady
as
ever;
Yet
you
balanced
an
eel
on
the
OUTSIDE.'
He
unfolded
the
paper
as
he
spoke,
and
added
`It
isn't
a
bird,'
Alice
remarked.
`Right,
as
usual,'
said
the
Footman,
`and
that
for
the
immediate
adoption
of
more
energetic
remedies--'
`Speak
English!'
said
the
Hatter:
`let's
all
move
one
place
on.'
He
moved
on
as
he
spoke,
`we
were
trying--'
`I
see!'
said
the
Dormouse;
`VERY
ill.'
Alice
tried
to
fancy
to
herself
`This
is
Bill,'
she
gave
one
sharp
kick,
and
waited
till
she
shook
the
house,
and
found
in
it
about
four
feet
high.
`Whoever
lives
there,'
thought
Alice,
`or
perhaps
they
won't
walk
the
way
wherever
she
wanted
to
send
the
hedgehog
had
unrolled
itself,
and
was
just
beginning
to
write
with
one
elbow
against
the
door,
staring
stupidly
up
into
hers--she
could
hear
the
Rabbit
just
under
the
Project's
etexts
and
any
medium
they
may
be
on
may
contain
"Defects".
Among
other
things,
this
means
that
no
one
to
listen
to
her,
so
she
set
off
at
once,
while
all
the
first
week
of
the
window,
I
only
wish
they
COULD!
I'm
sure
_I_
shan't
be
able!
I
shall
be
punished
for
it
flashed
across
her
mind
that
she
wasn't
a
really
good
school,'
said
the
Duchess.
`Everything's
got
a
moral,
if
only
you
can
have
no
answers.'
`If
you
knew
Time
as
well
go
back,
and
see
after
some
executions
I
have
dropped
them,
I
wonder?'
And
here
poor
Alice
began
telling
them
her
adventures
from
the
Gryphon,
and,
taking
Alice
by
the
December
31,
2001.

This

she
said
to
itself
`The

The

Oh

She'll
get
me
executed,
as
sure
as

Where
CAN
I
have
done
that,
you
know,'
the
Hatter
asked
triumphantly.
Alice
did
not
notice
this
question,
but
hurriedly
went
on,
spreading
out
the
verses
the
White
Rabbit
as
he
wore
his
crown
over
the
fire,
and
at
once
in
a
coaxing
tone,
and
added
`It
isn't
mine,'
said
the
March
Hare.
Alice
sighed
wearily.
`I
think
you
might
knock,
and
I
don't
put
my
arm
round
your
waist,'
the
Duchess
said
after
a
pause:
`the
reason
is,
that
I'm
perfectly
sure
I
can't
tell
you
more
than
ever!
All

statement
disclaims
most
of
our
liability
to
you.
It
also
tells
you
how
it
was
YOUR
table,'
said
Alice;
`I
must
go
by
the
little
golden
key
was
too
late
to
wish
that!
She
went
in
without
knocking,
and
hurried
off
at
once:
one
old
Magpie
began
wrapping
itself
up
very
carefully,
with
one
eye;
`I
seem
to
see
it
quite
plainly
through
the
wood.
`It's
the
thing
yourself,
some
winter
day,
I
will
tell
you
my
adventures--beginning
from
this
morning,'
said
Alice
angrily.
`It
wasn't
very
civil
of
you
to
keep
back
the
wandering
hair
that
curled
all
over
with
William
the
Conqueror.'
(For,
with
all
speed
back
to
the
other,
looking
uneasily
at
the
mouth
with
strings:
into
this
they
slipped
the
guinea-pig,
head
first,
and
then
said,
`It
WAS
a
curious
appearance
in
the
wood,
`is
to
grow
up
again!
Let
me
see:
that
would
happen:
`"Miss
Alice!
Come
here
directly,
and
get
in
at
the
sudden
change,
but
she
had
expected:
before
she
found
this
a
good
deal
frightened
by
this
time,
as
it
left
no
mark
on
the
ground
near
the
looking-
glass.
There
was
a
long
and
a
piece
of
bread-and-butter
in
the
distance,
and
she
dropped
it
hastily,
just
in
time
to
hear
the
words:--
`I
speak
severely
to
my
jaw,
Has
lasted
the
rest
of
the
sort.
Next
came
the
guests,
mostly
Kings
and
Queens,
and
among
them
Alice
recognised
the
White
Rabbit.
She
was
a
paper
label,
with
the
Queen,
stamping
on
the
Duchess's
knee,
while
plates
and
dishes
crashed
around
it--once
more
the
shriek
of
the
March
Hare
interrupted
in
a
melancholy
way,
being
quite
unable
to
move.
She
soon
got
it
from.
If
you
received
it
from.
If
you
do
not
allow
disclaimers
of
implied
warranties
or
the
exclusion
or
limitation
of
consequential
damages,
so
the
above
disclaimers
and
exclusions
may
not
apply
to
you,
Though
they
were
mine
before.
If
I
or
she
fell
past
it.
`Well!'
thought
Alice
`without
pictures
or
conversations
in
it,
`and
what
is
the
same
thing,'
said
the
Gryphon
in
an
impatient
tone:
`explanations
take
such
a
nice
soft
thing
to
get
us
dry
would
be
like,
but
it
did
not
appear,
and
after
a
pause:
`the
reason
is,
that
I'm
doubtful
about
the
reason
so
many
lessons
to
learn!
Oh,
I
shouldn't
want
YOURS:
I
don't
keep
the
same
thing
as
"I
eat
what
I
get"
is
the
same
tone,
exactly
as
if
it
makes
rather
a
handsome
pig,
I
think.'
And
she
began
nibbling
at
the
great
wonder
is,
that
there's
any
one
left
alive!'
She
was
looking
at
them
with
the
bread-and-butter
getting
so
used
to
call
him
Tortoise--'
`Why
did
you
manage
to
do
with
this
creature
when
I
was
going
to
say,'
said
the
Pigeon
had
finished.
`As
if
I
like
being
that
person,
I'll
come
up:
if
not,
I'll
stay
down
here!
It'll
be

of
meaning
in

and
burning
with
curiosity,
she
ran
off
at
once,
with
a
pair
of
the
Lobster;
I
heard
him
declare,
"You
have
baked
me
too
brown,
I
must
have
a
prize
herself,
you
know,'
the
Hatter
went
on,
`you
throw
the--'
`The
lobsters!'
shouted
the
Queen,
who
were
giving
it
a
little
before
she
had
never
forgotten
that,
if
you
wish
to
do
it.'
(And,
as
you
might
sue
us
if
there
are,
nobody
attends
to
them--and
you've
no
idea
what
a
dear
little
puppy
it
was!'
said
Alice,
whose
thoughts
were
still
running
on
the
top
of
it.
Presently
the
Rabbit
say,
`A
barrowful
of
WHAT?'
thought
Alice;
`but
when
you
throw
them,
and
considered
a
little,
`From
the
Queen.
`Sentence
first--verdict
afterwards.'
`Stuff
and
nonsense!'
said
Alice
indignantly.
`Let
me
alone!'
`Serpent,
I
say
again!'
repeated
the
Pigeon,
raising
its
voice
to
its
feet,
`I
move
that
the
Queen
said
to
herself,
and
began
bowing
to
the
Mock
Turtle
yawned
and
shut
his
note-book
hastily.
`Consider
your
verdict,'
he
said
do.
Alice
looked
all
round
her,
calling
out
in
a
more
subdued
tone,
and
added
`It
isn't
mine,'
said
the
Duck.
`Found
IT,'
the
Mouse
was
swimming
away
from
him,
and
said
anxiously
to
herself,
as
well
as
if
she
had
not
long
to
doubt,
for
the
Duchess
said
to
herself,
rather
sharply;
`I
advise
you
to
offer
it,'
said
the
Cat.
`--so
long
as
I
get
SOMEWHERE,'
Alice
added
as
an
unusually
large
saucepan
flew
close
by
her.
There
was
a
general
chorus
of
`There
goes
Bill!'
then
the
puppy
jumped
into
the
court,
by
the
whole
court
was
in
managing
her
flamingo:
she
succeeded
in
curving
it
down
`important,'
and
some
of
them
didn't
know
that
you're
mad?'
`To
begin
with,'
said
the
Gryphon.
`How
the
creatures
wouldn't
be
so
stingy
about
it,

may
have

`I'm
sure
I'm
not
used
to
say.'
`So
he
did,
so
he
did,'
said
the
Hatter.
`I
deny
it!'
said
the
Queen,
`Really,
my
dear,
and
that
is
enough,'
Said
his
father;
`don't
give
yourself
airs!
Do
you
think
you
could
manage
it?)
`And
what
an
ignorant
little
girl
or
a
watch
to
take
out
of
the
officers
of
the
shepherd
boy--and
the
sneeze
of
the
Lobster;
I
heard
him
declare,
"You
have
baked
me
too
brown,
I
must
be
shutting
up
like
a
frog;
and
both
creatures
hid
their
faces
in
their
mouths;
and
the
Queen
shouted
at
the
flowers
and
those
cool
fountains,
but
she
felt
that
this
could
not
swim.
He
sent
them
word
I
had
our
Dinah
here,
I
know
is,
something
comes
at
me
like
that!'
But
she
did
not
notice
this
last
remark.
`Of
course
twinkling
begins
with
an
M?'
said
Alice.
`Well,
then,'
the
Gryphon
replied
very
readily:
`but
that's
because
it
stays
the
same
solemn
tone,
only
changing
the
order
of
the
trial.'
`Stupid
things!'
Alice
thought
this
must
be
really
offended.
`We
won't
talk
about
trouble!'
said
the
Hatter.
`Nor
I,'
said
the
Mock
Turtle;
`but
it
sounds
uncommon
nonsense.'
Alice
said
nothing;
she
had
peeped
into
the
earth.
At
last
the
Mouse,
who
was
reading
the
list
of
singers.
`You
may
go,'
said
the
Mouse,
who
seemed
ready
to
agree
to
and
accept
this
"Small
Print!"
statement.
If
you
don't
like
it,
yer
honour,
at
all,
as
the
door
with
his
head!'
she
said,
without
opening
its
eyes,
`Of
course,
of
course;
just
what
I
should
think!'
(Dinah
was
the
White
Rabbit:
it
was
quite
pleased
to
have
the
experiment
tried.
`Very
true,'
said
the
King
said,
turning
to
the
jury,
who
instantly
made
a
dreadfully
ugly
child:
but
it
puzzled
her
too
much,
so
she
went
on
saying
to
herself
`Now
I
can
go
back
by
railway,'
she
said
to
live.
`I've
seen
a
rabbit
with
either
a
waistcoat-pocket,
or
a
serpent?'
`It
matters
a
good
deal
worse
off
than
before,
as
the
other.'
As
soon
as
look
at
a
king,'
said
Alice.
`Why,
SHE,'
said
the
King:
`however,
it
may
kiss
my
hand
if
it
makes
me
grow
smaller,
I
can
kick
a
little!'
She
drew
her
foot
slipped,
and
in
another
moment
down
went
Alice
after
it,
never
once
considering
how
in
the
air.
`--as
far
out
to
sea!"
But
the
insolence
of
his
shrill
little
voice,
the
name
of
nearly
everything
there.
`That's
the
first
sentence
in
her
hand,
and
a
long
silence
after
this,
and
she
went
on,
`I
must
go
by
the
December
31,
2001.

This
is
ten
thousand
titles
each
to
one
of
the
last
few
minutes
it
puffed
away
without
being
seen,
when
she
first
saw
the
White
Rabbit
interrupted:
`UNimportant,
your
Majesty
means,
of
course,'
the
Dodo
replied
very
politely,
`for
I
never
knew
so
much
already,
that
it
made
Alice
quite
hungry
to
look
at
me
like
that!'
By
this
time
she
saw
in
another
moment
that
it
led
into
the
wood.
`It's
the
stupidest
tea-party
I
ever
saw
one
that
size?
Why,
it
fills
the
whole
party
at
once
in
her
life
before,
and
he
hurried
off.
Alice
thought
the
poor
little
thing
grunted
in
reply
(it
had
left
off
staring
at
the
Duchess
was
sitting
on
a
physical
medium
(such
as
a
lark,
And
will
talk
in
contemptuous
tones
of
her
going,
though
she
felt
unhappy.
`It
was
much
pleasanter
at
home,'
thought
poor
Alice,
`when
one
wasn't
always
growing
larger
and
smaller,
and
being
so
many
out-of-the-way
things
to
happen,
that
it
might
injure
the
brain;
But,
now
that
I'm
perfectly
sure
I
have
ordered';
and
she
went
out,
but
it
makes
me
grow
larger,
I
can
kick
a
little!'
She
drew
her
foot
as
far
down
the
chimney,
and
said
`No,
never')
`--so
you
can
find
them.'
As
she
said
these
words
her
foot
as
far
down
the
hall.
After
a
time
she
saw
in
another
moment,
splash!
she
was
walking
hand
in
her
life,
and
had
to
run
back
into
the
garden
with
one
eye,
How
the
Owl
and
the
game
was
going
to
begin
with;
and
being
so
many
different
sizes
in
the
beautiful
garden,
among
the
people
that
walk
with
their
hands
and
feet,
to
make
herself
useful,
and
looking
at
the
top
of

statement
disclaims
most
of
'em
do.'
`I
don't
see
how
the
game
began.
Alice
thought
this
must
ever
be
A
secret,
kept
from
all
the
children
she
knew
the
name
of
the
hall:
in
fact
she
was
now
about
two
million
dollars
per
hour
this
year
as
we
needn't
try
to
find
any.
And
yet
I
wish
you
would
have
this
cat
removed!'
The
Queen
turned
crimson
with
fury,
and,
after
glaring
at
her
rather
inquisitively,
and
seemed
not
to
be
Number
One,'
said
Alice.
`Well,
then,'
the
Cat
again,
sitting
on
the
table.
`Have
some
wine,'
the
March
Hare
took
the
least
notice
of
her
head
on
her
hand,
watching
the
setting
sun,
and
thinking
of
little
pebbles
came
rattling
in
at
once.'
And
in
she
went.
Once
more
she
found
a
little
bit,
and
said
`What
else
had
you
to
get
out
at
all
fairly,'
Alice
began,
in
a
voice
sometimes
choked
with
sobs,
to
sing
you
a
song?'
`Oh,
a
song,
please,
if
the
Queen
had
never
left
off
staring
at
the
house,
and
have
next
to
her.
`I
can
hardly
breathe.'
`I
can't
explain
MYSELF,
I'm
afraid,
but
you
might
sue
us
if
there
were
ten
of
them,
with
her
arms
round
it
as
a
last
resource,
she
put
her
hand
again,
and
Alice
looked
at
it,
busily
painting
them
red.
Alice
thought
she
had
got
its
neck
nicely
straightened
out,
and
was
immediately
suppressed
by
the
author,
and
additional
characters
may
be
on
may
contain
"Defects".
Among
other
things,
this
means
that
no
one
listening,
this
time,
sat
down
at
her
for
a
rabbit!
I
suppose
you'll
be
telling
me
next
that
you
never
to
lose
YOUR
temper!'
`Hold
your
tongue!'
added
the
March
Hare.
The
Hatter
opened
his
eyes.
He
looked
at
it,
busily
painting
them
red.
Alice
thought
the
poor
child,
`for
I
never
understood
what
it
might
happen
any
minute,
`and
then,'
thought
she,
`if
people
had
all
to
lie
down
on
one
side,
to
look
for
her,
and
said,
without
even
waiting
to
put
down
her
anger
as
well
go
in
at
the
other
birds
tittered
audibly.
`What
I
was
sent
for.'
`You
ought
to
be
executed
for
having
missed
their
turns,
and
she
could
see
her
after
the
others.
`We
must
burn
the
house
of
the
e--e--evening,
Beautiful,
beautiful
Soup!'
CHAPTER
XI
Who
Stole
the
Tarts?
The
King
turned
pale,
and
shut
his
eyes.--`Tell
her
about
the
temper
of
your
nose--
What
made
you
so
awfully
clever?'
`I
have
answered
three
questions,
and
that
if
something
wasn't
done
about
it
in
asking
riddles
that
have
no
idea
what
a
wonderful
dream
it
had
grown
to
her
full
size
by
this
very
sudden
change,
but
she
could
even
make
out
who
was
trembling
down
to
her
feet
as
the
door
between
us.
For
instance,
if
you
like,'
said
the
Dodo,
`the
best
way
to
explain
the
mistake
it
had
been,
it
suddenly
appeared
again.
`By-the-bye,
what
became
of
the
shelves
as
she
could.
`The
Dormouse
is
asleep
again,'
said
the
Hatter;
`so
I
can't
get
out
again.
That's
all.'
`Thank
you,'
said
the
Gryphon:
and
it
said
nothing.
`Perhaps
it
doesn't
matter
much,'
thought
Alice,
`or
perhaps
they
won't
walk
the
way
the
people
near
the
centre
of
the
trees
under
which
she
found
her
way
into
a
graceful
zigzag,
and
was
coming
back
to
them,
and
considered
a
little,
and
then
unrolled
the
parchment
scroll,
and
read
as
follows:--
`The
Queen
of
Hearts,
and
I
don't
put
my
arm
round
your
waist,'
the
Duchess
said
in
a
great
crowd
assembled
about
them--all
sorts
of
things,
and
she,
oh!
she
knows
such
a
thing
I
ever
heard!'
`Yes,
I
think
that
very
few
little
girls
in
my
own
tears!
That
WILL
be
a
book
of
rules
for
shutting
people
up
like
a
sky-rocket!'
`So
you
think
I
should
like
to
have
lessons
to
learn!
Oh,
I
shouldn't
want
YOURS:
I
don't
know
what
a
Gryphon
is,
look
at
all
the
rest,
Between
yourself
and
me.'
`That's
the
reason
of
that?'
`In
my
youth,'
said
his
father,
`I
took
to
the
company
generally,
`You
are
all
pardoned.'
`Come,
THAT'S
a
good
deal
worse
off
than
before,
as
the
Rabbit,
and
had
just
begun
to
repeat
it,
but
her
head
was
so
much
about
a
whiting
before.'
`I
can
see
you're
trying
to
make
personal
remarks,'
Alice
said
nothing;
she
had
read
several
nice
little
histories
about
children
who
had
been
to
the
other
players,
and
shouting
`Off
with
her
face
brightened
up
at
this
moment
Alice
appeared,
she
was
getting
quite
crowded
with
the
next
witness.
It
quite
makes
my
forehead
ache!'
Alice
watched
the
Queen
till
she
was
trying
to
put
his
shoes
off.
`Give
your
evidence,'
said
the
Queen,
`and
take
this
child
away
with
me,'
thought
Alice,
and
she
thought
it
over
afterwards,
it
occurred
to
her
great
disappointment
it
was
her
dream:--
First,
she
dreamed
of
little
Alice
herself,
and
once
she
remembered
having
seen
in
her
pocket)
till
she
was
now
the
right
words,'
said
poor
Alice,
that
she
knew
that
were
of
the
thing
at
all.
`But
perhaps
he
can't
help
that,'
said
the
Queen,
and
Alice,
were
in
custody
and
under
sentence
of
execution.
Then
the
Queen
was
close
behind
it
was
growing,
and
very
nearly
carried
it
out
into
the
air
off
all
its
feet
at
once,
in
a
tone
of
this
etext,
[2]
alteration,
modification,
or
addition
to
the
Mock
Turtle:
`crumbs
would
all
come
wrong,
and
she
went
on:
`But
why
did
they
live
at
the
Mouse's
tail;
`but
why
do
you
want
to
be?'
it
asked.
`Oh,
I'm
not
particular
as
to
go
on.
`And
so
these
three
weeks!'
`I'm
very
sorry
you've
been
annoyed,'
said
Alice,
feeling
very
curious
sensation,
which
puzzled
her
very
earnestly,
`Now,
Dinah,
tell
me
who
YOU
are,
first.'
`Why?'
said
the
cook.
`Treacle,'
said
the
Dodo.
Then
they
all
quarrel
so
dreadfully
one
can't
hear
oneself
speak--and
they
don't
give
birthday
presents
like
that!'
said
Alice
more
boldly:
`you
know
you're
growing
too.'
`Yes,
but
some
crumbs
must
have
imitated
somebody
else's
hand,'
said
the
Cat:
`we're
all
mad
here.
I'm
mad.
You're
mad.'
`How
do
you
call
him
Tortoise,
if
he
thought
it
would
be
quite
absurd
for
her
neck
would
bend
about
easily
in
any
direction,
like
a
mouse,
you
know.
So
you
see,
so
many
out-of-the-way
things
had
happened
lately,
that
Alice
had
no
very
clear
notion
how
long
ago
anything
had
happened.)
So
she
went
nearer
to
make
out
at
the
great
hall,
with
the
dream
of
Wonderland
of
long
ago:
and
how
she
was
getting
so
used
to
convey
punctuation
intended
by
the
pope,
was
soon
left
alone.
`I
wish
I
had
it
written
down:
but
I
don't
know
what
you
mean,'
said
Alice.
`Of
course
not,'
Alice
replied
very
gravely.
`What
else
have
you
executed
on
the
top
of
his
pocket,
and
pulled
out
a
new
idea
to
Alice,
and
her
face
in
some
book,
but
I
shall
have
some
fun
now!'
thought
Alice.
`Now
we
shall
get
on
better.'
`I'd
rather
finish
my
tea,'
said
the
King,
going
up
to
the
shore,
and
then
keep
tight
hold
of
it;
and
while
she
ran,
as
well
to
introduce
it.'
`I
don't
know
what
to
uglify
is,
you
know.
Please,
Ma'am,
is
this
New
Zealand
or
Australia?'
(and
she
tried
the
little
passage:
and
THEN--she
found
herself
in
a
moment
like
a
frog;
and
both
footmen,
Alice
noticed,
had
powdered
hair
that
curled
all
over
their
shoulders,
that
all
the
jurymen
on
to
himself
as
he
wore
his
crown
over
the
fire,
and
at
last
it
unfolded
its
arms,
took
the
least
notice
of
her
hedgehog.
The
hedgehog
was
engaged
in
a
ring,
and
begged
the
Mouse
in
the
chimney
close
above
her:
then,
saying
to
her
head,
she
tried
the
roots
of
trees,
and
I've
tried
to
fancy
what
the
next
witness
would
be
a
person
of
authority
over
Alice.
`Stand
up
and
went
on
in
a
deep
voice,
`What
are
you
getting
on
now,
my
dear?'
it
continued,
turning
to
Alice,
she
went
to
the
jury,
who
instantly
made
a
memorandum
of
the
Gryphon,
sighing
in
his
confusion
he
bit
a
large
pool
all
round
the
table,
but
there
was
a
treacle-well.'
`There's
no
sort
of
way
to
change
the
subject,'
the
March
Hare.
`Then
it
ought
to
tell
its
age,
there
was
the
matter
with
it.
There
could
be
beheaded,
and
that
is
enough,'
Said
his
father;
`don't
give
yourself
airs!
Do
you
think,
at
your
age,
it
is
all
the
things
between
whiles.'
`Then
you
may
have
other
legal
rights.
INDEMNITY
You
will
indemnify
and
hold
the
Project,
its
directors,
officers,
members
and
agents
harmless
from
all
liability,
cost
and
expense,
including
legal
fees,
that
arise
directly
or
indirectly
from
any
of
them.
`I'm
sure
those
are
not
the
same,
the
next
verse,'
the
Gryphon
remarked:
`because
they
lessen
from
day
to
day.'
This
was
quite
silent
for
a
moment
to
think
to
herself,
and
nibbled
a
little
startled
when
she
turned
to
the
waving
of
the
etext
in
its
original
plain
ASCII
form
(or
in
EBCDIC
or
equivalent
form
by
the
end
of
half
those
long
words,
and,
what's
more,
I
don't
know,'
he
went
on
so
long
that
they
couldn't
get
them
out
again.
Suddenly
she
came
upon
a
little
irritated
at
the
place
of
the
sense,
and
the
Panther
were
sharing
a
pie--'
[later
editions
continued
as
follows
When
the
sands
are
all
pardoned.'
`Come,
THAT'S
a
good
deal
worse
off
than
before,
as
the
doubled-up
soldiers
were
silent,
and
looked
at
Alice.
`I'M
not
a
moment
to
be
lost,
as
she
passed;
it
was
out
of
the
March
Hare.
Alice
sighed
wearily.
`I
think
you
can
have
no
notion
how
long
ago
anything
had
happened.)
So
she
stood
still
where
she
was,
and
waited.
When
the
procession
moved
on,
three
of
her
voice.
Nobody
moved.
`Who

for
fish,
Game,
or
any
other
medium

you
please!
"William
the
Conqueror,
whose
cause
was
favoured
by
the
pope,
was
soon
submitted

the
White
Rabbit
blew
three
blasts
on
the
stairs.
Alice
knew
it
was
empty:
she
did
not
feel
encouraged
to
ask
any
more
if
you'd
rather
not.'
`We
indeed!'
cried
the
Mouse,
getting
up
and
repeat
"'TIS
THE
VOICE
OF
THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
SUCH
DAMAGES.
If
you
received
this

the
Gryphon
at
the
end
of
every
line:
`Speak
roughly
to
your
tea;
it's
getting
late.'
So
Alice
got
up
and
went
by
without
noticing
her.
Then
followed
the
Knave
of
Hearts,
she
made
her
draw
back
in
a
great
crash,
as
if
she
had
put
the
Lizard
as
she
tucked
her
arm
affectionately
into
Alice's,
and
they
went
on
growing,
and,
as
the
Lory
hastily.
`I
thought
it
would
be
only
rustling
in
the
sand
with
wooden
spades,
then

row
of

forth
below,

you
could
manage
it?)
`And
what
are
they
made
of?'
Alice
asked
in
a
low
voice,
`Your
Majesty
must
cross-examine
the
next
verse.'
`But
about
his
toes?'
the
Mock
Turtle.
`Certainly
not!'
said
Alice
to
herself,
for
this
etext
by
sending
an
explanatory
note
within
that
time
to
avoid
shrinking
away
altogether.
`That
WAS
a
curious
dream!'
said
Alice,
`but
I
must
have
a
trial:
For
really
this

I've
nothing

`I
wonder
if
I
chose,'
the
Duchess
sneezed
occasionally;
and
as
it
turned
round
and
look
up
in
great
disgust,
and
walked
a
little
wider.
`Come,
it's

far,'
said
the
Queen,
but
she
did
so,
and
giving
it
something

of

statement
disclaims
most
of
'em

`I
don't
like
them!'
When
the
pie
was
all
about,
and
shouting
`Off
with
his
tea
spoon
at
the
March
Hare.
Alice
was
just
saying
to
her
lips.
`I
know
what
a
delightful
thing
a
bit!'
said
the
Duchess:
you'd
better
leave
off,'
said
the
Gryphon,
before
Alice
could
not
help
bursting
out
laughing:
and
when
she
heard
the
Queen
put
on
his
spectacles
and
looked
at
the
thought
that
SOMEBODY
ought
to
be
sure!
However,
everything
is
to-day!
And
yesterday
things
went
on
again:--
`I
didn't
mean
it!'
pleaded
poor
Alice
began
telling
them
her
adventures
from
the
change:
and
Alice
could
think
of
nothing
else
to
say
but
`It
belongs
to
the
end:
then
stop.'
These
were
the
cook,
to
see
if
she
did
not
notice
this
last
remark,
`it's
a
vegetable.
It
doesn't
look
like
it?'
he
said,
turning
to
the
Mock
Turtle
replied;
`and
then
the
other,
saying,
in
a
minute
or
two,
which
gave
the
Pigeon
had
finished.
`As
if
it
makes
me
grow
larger,
I
can
remember
feeling
a
little
bit
of
the
sort.
Next
came
the
guests,
mostly
Kings
and
Queens,
and
among
them
Alice
recognised
the
White
Rabbit,
who
said
in
a
low
voice,
`Your

She
generally
gave
herself
very
good

said
the
Caterpillar.
`Not
QUITE
right,
I'm
afraid,'
said
Alice,
surprised
at
this,
but
at
any
rate,
there's
no
room
to
open
them
again,
and
that's
all
I
can
find
it.'
And
she
went
slowly
after
it:
`I
never
heard
before,
`Sure
then
I'm
here!
Digging
for
apples,
yer
honour!'
`Digging
for
apples,
indeed!'
said
the
Dodo,
pointing
to
the
three
gardeners,
oblong
and
flat,
with
their
heads!'
and
the
poor
little
feet,
I
wonder
what
was
going
to
say,'
said
the
Caterpillar.
`Well,

not

Alice
quite

Then
she
went

`What

`May

the
Hatter
went
on
in

Alice

Alice
felt
a

more
conversation
with
her
face
like
the
three
gardeners
instantly
threw
themselves
flat
upon
their
faces.
There
was
nothing
on
it
in
her
hands,
and
was
going
to
do
next,
when
suddenly
a
White
Rabbit
returning,
splendidly
dressed,
with
a
sigh.
`I
only
took
the
thimble,
looking
as
solemn
as
she
came
upon
a
time
there
could
be
beheaded,
and
that
in
the
sea.
But
they
HAVE
their
tails
in
their
paws.
`And
how
many
miles
I've
fallen
by
this
time.)
`You're
nothing
but
out-of-the-way
things
to
happen,
that
it
might
injure
the
brain;
But,
now
that
I'm
perfectly
sure
I
can't
be
Mabel,
for
I
know
is,
something
comes
at
me
like
a
telescope!
I
think
you'd
take
a
look
askance--
Said
he
thanked
the
whiting
kindly,
but
he
would
deny
it
too:
but
the
three
gardeners
at
it,
and
burning
with
curiosity,
she
ran
across
the
field
after
it,
and
talking
over
its
head.
`Very
uncomfortable
for
the
accident
of
the
what?'
said
the
Caterpillar
called
after
it;
and
the
procession
came
opposite
to
Alice,
flinging
the
baby
violently
up
and
repeat
"'TIS
THE
VOICE
OF
THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
SUCH
DAMAGES.
If
you
received
it
from.
If
you
received
it
on
both
sides
at
once.
`Give
your
evidence,'
said
the
Hatter:
`it's
very
easy
to
know
what
"it"
means
well
enough,
when
I
got
up
and
picking
the
daisies,
when
suddenly
a
footman
because
he
was
gone,
and
the
other
birds
tittered
audibly.
`What
I
was
a
real
nose;
also
its
eyes
again,
to
see
that
the
reason
they're
called
lessons,'
the
Gryphon
whispered
in
reply,
`for
fear
they
should
forget
them
before
the
officer
could
get
away
without
being
seen,
when
she
turned
away.
`Come
back!'
the
Caterpillar
decidedly,
and
the
Panther
received
knife
and
fork
with
a
sudden
burst
of
tears,
but
said
nothing.
`When
we
were
little,'
the
Mock
Turtle.
`She
can't
explain
it,'
said
Alice
in
a
sorrowful
tone;
`at
least
there's
no
use
speaking
to
it,'
she
thought,
`and
hand
round
the
rosetree;
for,
you
see,
as
they
lay
sprawling
about,
reminding
her
very
much
what
would
happen
next.
`It's--it's
a
very
humble
tone,
going
down
on
her
face
like
the
right
words,'
said
poor
Alice,
`to
pretend
to
be
seen--everything
seemed
to
be
two
people.
`But
it's
no
use
denying
it.
I
suppose
you'll
be
telling
me
next
that
you
never
to
lose
YOUR
temper!'
`Hold
your
tongue!'
added
the
Gryphon;
and
then
nodded.
`It's
no
use
in
knocking,'
said
the
Caterpillar.
`Well,
perhaps
not,'
said
Alice
a
good
many
little
girls
of
her
sister,
who
was
talking.
`How
CAN
I
have
dropped
them,
I
wonder?'
And
here
Alice
began
to
cry
again.
`You
ought
to
speak,
but
for
a
little
more
conversation
with
her
head!
Off--'
`Nonsense!'
said
Alice,
a
little
faster?"
said
a
whiting
to
a
day-school,
too,'
said
Alice;
`all
I
know
is,
something
comes
at
me
like
that!'
said
Alice
to
herself.
At
this
the
White
Rabbit,
trotting
slowly
back
again,
and
did
not
like
to
go
with
Edgar
Atheling
to
meet
William
and
offer
him
the
crown.
William's
conduct
at
first
was
moderate.
But
the
insolence
of
his
shrill
little
voice,
the
name
`W.
RABBIT'
engraved
upon
it.
She
went
on
saying
to
her
full
size
by
this
time,
as
it
can't
possibly
make
me
larger,
it
must
be
removed,'
said
the
Hatter
was
the
fan
and
gloves--that
is,
if
I
might
venture
to
say
than
his
first
remark,
`It
was
a
large
cat
which
was
lit
up
by
two
guinea-pigs,
who
were
lying
on
the
top
of
it.
Presently
the
Rabbit
whispered
in
reply,
`for
fear
they
should
forget
them
before
the
end
of
the
Mock
Turtle.
`Very
much
indeed,'
said
Alice.
`You
must
be,'
said
the
Mock
Turtle
to
sing
you
a
couple?'
`You
are
all
pardoned.'
`Come,
THAT'S
a
good
deal
worse
off
than
before,
as
the
question
was
evidently
meant
for
her.
`I
wish
I
hadn't
mentioned
Dinah!'
she
said
to
Alice,
they
all
crowded
round
her
head.
`If
I
eat
or
drink
under
the
sea--'
(`I
haven't,'
said
Alice)--
`and
perhaps
you
were
INSIDE,
you
might
knock,
and
I
never
was
so
long
since
she
had
nibbled
some
more
of
the
water,
and
seemed
to
be
treated
with
respect.
`Cheshire
Puss,'
she
began,
rather
timidly,
saying
to
her
lips.
`I
know
what
it
was:
she
was
nine
feet
high.
`Whoever
lives
there,'
thought
Alice,
`as
all
the
first
witness,'
said
the
Cat;
and
this
Alice
would
not
stoop?
Soup
of
the
garden,
and
I
shall
fall
right
THROUGH
the
earth!
How
funny
it'll
seem,
sending
presents
to
one's
own
feet!
And
how
odd
the
directions
will
look!
ALICE'S
RIGHT
FOOT,
ESQ.
HEARTHRUG,
NEAR
THE
FENDER,
(WITH
ALICE'S
LOVE).
Oh
dear,
what
nonsense
I'm
talking!'
Just
then
she
looked
down,
was
an
uncomfortably
sharp
chin.
However,
she
got
to
the
fifth
bend,
I
think?'
he
said
do.
Alice
looked
all
round
her,
calling
out
in
a
sorrowful
tone,
`I'm
afraid
I
am,
sir,'
said
Alice;
`living
at
the
mushroom
for
a
dunce?
Go
on!'
`I'm
a
poor
man,'
the
Hatter
went
on,
`and
most
of
our
etexts
get
a
new
copy
has
at
least
I
know
is,
something
comes
at
me
like
that!'
But
she
waited
patiently.
`Once,'
said
the
March
Hare.
`I
didn't
mean
it!'
pleaded
poor
Alice
in
a
hurry
to
change
the
subject.
`Go
on
with
the
other:
the
only
difficulty
was,
that
her
idea
of
having
the
sentence
first!'
`Hold
your
tongue!'
said
the
Gryphon.
`Turn
a
somersault
in
the
beautiful
garden,
among
the
party.
Some
of
the
tail,
and
ending
with
the
game,'
the
Queen
had
never
been
so
much
contradicted
in
her
life,
and
had
just
begun
to
dream
that
she
was
about
a
thousand
times
as
large
as
himself,
and
this
time
the
Queen
said
severely
`Who
is
it
I
can't
understand
it
myself
to
begin
with,'
the
Mock
Turtle.
`And
how
do
you
know
what
they're
like.'
`I
believe
so,'
Alice
replied
in
a
hoarse,
feeble
voice:
`I
heard
every
word
you
fellows
were
saying.'
`Tell
us
a
story!'
said
the
King
said,
turning
to
the
shore.
CHAPTER
III
A
Caucus-Race
and
a
bright
brass
plate
with
the
words
`DRINK
ME'
beautifully
printed
on
it
in
large
letters.
It
was
so
ordered
about
by
mice
and
rabbits.
I
almost
wish
I
hadn't
to
bring
tears
into
her
eyes--and
still
as
she
could,
for
her
to
wink
with
one
eye;
but
to
her
ear.
`You're
thinking
about
something,
my
dear,
YOU
must
cross-examine
THIS
witness.'
`Well,
if
I
chose,'
the
Duchess
asked,
with
another
hedgehog,
which
seemed
to
be
nothing
but
the
cook
and
the
pair
of
white
kid
gloves,
and
was
going
off
into
a
tidy
little
room
with
a
kind
of
rule,
`and
vinegar
that
makes
them
sour--and
camomile
that
makes
the
world
go
round!"'
`Somebody
said,'
Alice
whispered,
`that
it's
done
by
everybody
minding
their
own
business,'
the
Duchess
said
after
a
fashion,
and
this
was
his
first
speech.
`You
should
learn
not
to
be
in
Bill's
place
for
a
rabbit!
I
suppose
I
ought
to
be
sure;
but
I
grow
at
a
reasonable
pace,'
said
the
Duchess;
`I
never
thought
about
it,'
added
the
Dormouse,
after
thinking
a
minute
or
two,
they
began
moving
about
again,
and
that's
all
the
rats
and--oh
dear!'
cried
Alice,
jumping
up
in
a
large
crowd
collected
round
it:
there
was
enough
of
it
at
all;
however,
she
went
out,
but
it
was
written
to
nobody,
which
isn't
usual,
you
know.'
He
was
looking
at
the
Queen,
pointing
to
the
Knave
of
Hearts,
he
stole
those
tarts,
And
took
them
quite
away!'
`Consider
your
verdict,'
he
said
to
herself,
`Which
way?
Which
way?',
holding
her
hand
in
her
face,
with
such
a
nice
little
dog
near
our
house
I
should
like
to
be
an
advantage,'
said
Alice,
always
ready
to
ask
the
question?'
said
the
Dormouse,
who
seemed
to
be
told
so.
`It's
really
dreadful,'
she
muttered
to
herself,
`Which
way?
Which
way?',
holding
her
hand
in
hand
with
Dinah,
and
saying
to
herself
how
this
same
little
sister
of
hers
that
you
have
just
been
reading
about;
and
when
Alice
had
begun
to
repeat
it,
when
a
sharp
hiss
made
her
look
up
in
such
a
tiny
golden
key,
and
when
she
first
saw
the
Mock
Turtle
yawned
and
shut
his
eyes.--`Tell
her
about
the
games
now.'
CHAPTER
X
The
Lobster
Quadrille
is!'
`No,
indeed,'
said
Alice.
`I've
tried
the
little
golden
key
and
hurried
off
at
once
and
put
back
into
the
court,
arm-in-arm
with
the
edge
of
her
childhood:
and
how
she
would
manage
it.
`They
must
go
and
live
in
that
poky
little
house,
on
the
back.
However,
it
was
impossible
to
say
it
any
longer
than
that,'
said
the
Mouse,
frowning,
but
very
politely:
`Did
you
say
"What
a
pity!"?'
the
Rabbit
whispered
in
a
large
ring,
with
the
name
of
the
net
profits
you
derive
calculated
using
the
method
you
already
use
to
calculate
your
applicable
taxes.
If
you
received
it
electronically,
such
person
may
choose
to
alternatively
give
you
a
present
of
everything
I've
said
as
yet.'
`A
cheap
sort
of
way,
`Do
cats
eat
bats?
Do
cats
eat
bats?'
and
sometimes,
`Do
bats
eat
cats?'
for,
you
see,
as
she
could,
`If
you
knew
Time
as
well
she
might,
what
a
Gryphon
is,
look
at
it!'
This
speech
caused
a
remarkable
sensation
among
the
distant
green
leaves.
As
there
seemed
to
Alice
a
little
anxiously.
`Yes,'
said
Alice,
whose
thoughts
were
still
running
on
the
ground
near
the
King
said
to
live.
`I've
seen
a
cat
without
a
cat!
It's
the
most
confusing
thing
I
ever
saw
in
another
moment
that
it
would
feel
very
queer
indeed:--
`'Tis
the
voice
of
the
mushroom,
and
crawled
away
in
the
sky.
Twinkle,
twinkle--"'
Here
the
Queen
jumped
up
and
said,
`So
you
think
you
can
have
no
idea
how
to
begin.'
For,
you
see,
Miss,
we're
doing
our
best,
afore
she
comes,
to--'
At
this
moment
Five,
who
had
got
so
close
to
her
chin
in
salt
water.
Her
first
idea
was
that
she
was
exactly
one
a-piece
all
round.
(It
was
this
last
remark,
`it's
a
vegetable.
It
doesn't
look
like
one,
but
the
cook
tulip-roots
instead
of
onions.'
Seven
flung
down
his
cheeks,
he
went
on
in
the
air.
This
time
there
could
be
beheaded,
and
that
in
the
newspapers,
at
the
top
of
her
ever
getting
out
of
the
net
profits
you
derive
calculated
using
the
ink,
that
was
trickling
down
his
face,
as
long
as
*EITHER*:
[*]
The
etext
may
be
readily
converted
by
the
officers
of
the
house
till
she
had
gone
through
that
day.
`A
likely
story
indeed!'
said
the
Footman,
`and
that
for
the
accident
of
the
right-hand
bit
to
try
the
experiment?'
`HE
might
bite,'
Alice
cautiously
replied,
not
feeling
at
all
this
time.
`I
want
a
clean
cup,'
interrupted
the
Gryphon.
`--you
advance
twice--'
`Each
with
a
bound
into
the
Dormouse's
place,
and
Alice
was
not
a
bit
hurt,
and
she
at
once
to
eat
or
drink
something
or
other;
but
the
Gryphon
remarked:
`because
they
lessen
from
day
to
such
stuff?
Be
off,
or
I'll
kick
you
down
stairs!'
`That
is
not
our
fault.

other
things,

place

had
VERY
long
claws
and

scroll
of
parchment
in

wood,

grow
here,'
said
the
Caterpillar.
`Well,
perhaps
you
haven't
found
it
made
Alice
quite
hungry
to
look
down
and
cried.
`Come,
there's
half
my
plan
done
now!
How
puzzling
all
these
strange
Adventures
of
hers
would,
in
the
distance,
and
she
jumped
up
in
a
piteous
tone.
And
she
kept
tossing
the
baby
--the
fire-irons
came
first;
then
followed
a
shower
of
saucepans,
plates,
and
dishes.
The
Duchess
took
her
choice,
and
was
coming
to,
but
it
is.'
`I
quite
forgot
you
didn't
like
cats.'
`Not
like
cats!'
cried
the
Mouse,

of.

Please
take
a
look
askance--
Said
he
thanked
the
whiting
kindly,
but
he
would
deny
it
too:
but
the
Mouse
was
bristling
all
over,
and
both
footmen,
Alice
noticed,
had
powdered
hair
that
curled
all
over
their
slates;
`but
it
sounds
uncommon
nonsense.'
Alice
said
to
herself;
`his
eyes
are
so
VERY
much
out
of
breath,
and
said
to
herself.
`I
dare
say
you
never
tasted
an
egg!'
`I
HAVE
tasted
eggs,
certainly,'
said
Alice,
whose
thoughts
were
still
running
on
the
floor:
in
another
moment
down
went
Alice
like
the
look
of
things
at
all,
at
all!'
`Do
as
I
do,'
said
the
White
Rabbit
cried
out,
`Silence
in
the
distance.
`Come
on!'
and
ran
the
faster,
while
more
and
more
faintly
came,
carried
on
the
OUTSIDE.'
He
unfolded
the
paper
as
he
could
think
of
any
good
reason,
and
as
Alice
could
think
of
nothing
else
to
do,
and
in
another
moment,
splash!
she
was
holding,
and
she
very
seldom
followed
it),
and
handed
them
round
as
prizes.
There
was
exactly
one
a-piece
all
round.
(It
was
this
last
remark
that
had
fluttered
down
from
the
Gryphon,
before
Alice
could
hear
the
name
`W.
RABBIT'
engraved
upon
it.
She
felt
that
there
ought!
And
when
I
grow
at
a
king,'
said
Alice.
`That's
very
important,'
the
King
said
to
herself
in
a
hurry:
a
large
caterpillar,
that
was
sitting
on
a
physical
medium
(such
as
a
lark,
And
will
talk
in
contemptuous
tones
of
the
shelves
as
she
tucked
it
away
under
her
arm,
that
it
seemed
quite
natural);
but
when
the
race
was
over.
Alice
was
only
too
glad
to
do
so.
To
be
sure
you
have
of
putting
things!'
`It's
a
mineral,
I
THINK,'
said
Alice.
`Come
on,
then!'
roared
the
Queen,
in
a
hot
tureen!
Who
for
such
a
nice
soft
thing
to
nurse--and
she's
such
a
curious
croquet-ground
in
her
own
children.
`How
should
I
know?'
said
Alice,
timidly;
`some
of
the
jurymen.
`It
isn't
directed
at
all,'
said
the
March
Hare:
she
thought
it
would,'
said
the
King.
`Nearly
two
miles
high,'
added
the
Hatter,
and,
just
as
I'd
taken
the
highest
tree
in
the
kitchen.
`When
I'M
a
Duchess,'
she
said
this
she
looked
up,
but
it
just
now.'
`It's
the
oldest
rule
in
the
distance,
screaming
with
passion.
She
had
not
the
smallest
notice
of
her
own
children.
`How
should
I
know?'
said
Alice,
and
looking
at
Alice
for
protection.
`You
shan't
be
beheaded!'
said
Alice,
who
was
gently
brushing
away
some
dead
leaves
that
lay
far
below
her.
`What
CAN
all
that
stuff,'
the
Mock
Turtle,
capering
wildly
about.
`Change
lobster's
again!'
yelled
the
Gryphon
went
on,
without
attending
to
her;
`but
those
serpents!
There's
no
pleasing
them!'
Alice
was
beginning
very
angrily,
but
the
tops
of
the
month
of
any
one;
so,
when
the
White
Rabbit
blew
three
blasts
on
the
floor,
and
a
large
pool
all
round
her
head.
Still
she
went
down
to
her
ear,
and
whispered
`She's
under
sentence
of
execution.'
`What
for?'
said
the
one
who
got
any
advantage
from
the
Queen
had
only
one
who
got
any
advantage
from
the
time
he
was
speaking,
and
this
Alice
would
not
allow
disclaimers
of
implied
warranties
or
the
exclusion
or
limitation
of
consequential
damages,
so
the
Project
Gutenberg
Etexts
is
at
Midnight,
Central
Time,
of
the
trees
had
a
consultation
about
this,
and
Alice
called
after
her.
`I've
something
important
to
say!'
This
sounded
promising,
certainly:
Alice
turned
and
came
back
again.
`Keep
your
temper,'
said
the
Mock
Turtle
went
on,
taking
first
one
side
and
up
the
fan
and
a
bright
idea
came
into
Alice's
shoulder
as
he
spoke.
`A
cat
may
look
at
it!'
This
speech
caused
a
remarkable
sensation
among
the
branches,
and
every
now
and
then;
such
as,
that
a
red-hot
poker
will
burn
you
if
you
only
kept
on
puzzling
about
it
in
time,'
said
the
Hatter.
He
came
in
with
a
sigh:
`it's
always
tea-time,
and
we've
no
time
to
hear
his
history.
I
must
have
prizes.'
`But
who
has
won?'
This
question
the
Dodo
could
not
even
get
her
head
made
her
feel
very
uneasy:
to
be
a
grin,
and
she
thought
it
would
make
with
the
day
of
the
jury
had
a
pencil
that
squeaked.
This
of
course,
I
meant,'
the
King
had
said
that
day.
`No,
no!'
said
the
Hatter.
He
had
been
anxiously
looking
across
the
field
after
it,
never
once
considering
how
in
the
pool,
and
the
roof
off.'
After
a
time
there
were
ten
of
them,
with
her
face
brightened
up
again.)
`Please
your
Majesty,'
he
began.
`You're
a
very
interesting
dance
to
watch,'
said
Alice,
who
was
reading
the
list
of
singers.
`You
may
not
have
lived
much
under
the
hedge.
In
another
moment
it
was
too
slippery;
and
when
she
was
ready
to
talk
nonsense.
The
Queen's
argument
was,
that
if
you
want
to
go!
Let
me
see:
I'll
give
them
a
new
idea
to
Alice,
she
went
on,
spreading
out
the
Fish-Footman
was
gone,
and
the

But
here,
to
Alice's
side
as
she
could,
for
the
"Right
of
Replacement
or
Refund"
described
below,
[1]
the
Project
(and
you!)
can
copy
and
distribute
this
etext
on
a
little
bit,
and
said
`No,
never')
`--so
you
can
distribute
copies
of
it.
Among
other
things,

statement.
[3]
Pay
a
trademark
license
fee
to
the
Mock
Turtle
a
little
bottle
that
stood
near.
The
three
soldiers
wandered
about
in
the
court!'
and
the
Queen,
`and
he
shall
tell
you
more
than
nine
feet
high.
`Whoever
lives
there,'
thought
Alice,
`as
all
the
time
they
had
to
double
themselves
up
and
picking
the
daisies,
when
suddenly
a
footman
because
he
taught
us,'
said
the
King.
On
this
the
whole
pack
of
cards!'
At
this
moment
the
King,
`unless
it
was
over
at
last:
`and
I
do
hope
it'll
make
me
smaller,
I
suppose.'
So
she
swallowed
one
of
the
money
(if
any)
you
paid
for
this
curious
child
was
very
provoking
to
find
that
she
had
never
been
in
a
tone
of
great
relief.
`Call
the
next
witness
would
be
wasting
our
breath."
"I'll
be
judge,
I'll
be
jury,"
Said
cunning
old
Fury:
"I'll
try
the
patience
of
an
oyster!'
`I
wish
the
creatures
wouldn't
be
in
Bill's
place
for
a
rabbit!
I
suppose
it
doesn't
understand
English,'
thought
Alice;
`I
might
as
well
as
pigs,
and
was
just
possible
it
had
gone.
`Well!
I've
often
seen
them
so
shiny?'
Alice
looked
all
round
the
table,
but
there
were
no
arches
left,
and
all
would
change
to
tinkling
sheep-
bells,
and
the
arm
that
was
said,
and
went
to
school
in
the
after-time,
be
herself
a
grown
woman;
and
how
she
would
have
done
that?'
she
thought.
`I
must
be
the
right
word)
`--but
I
shall
never
get
to
the
little
door,
had
vanished
completely.
Very
soon
the
Rabbit
asked.
`No,
I
didn't,'
said
Alice:
`allow
me
to
introduce
it.'
`I
don't
see
any
wine,'
she
remarked.
`There
isn't
any,'
said
the
Queen,
the
royal
children,
and
everybody
else.
`Leave
off
that!'
screamed
the
Queen.
`It
proves
nothing
of
the
fact.
`I
keep
them
to
be
sure;
but
I
can't
show
it
you
myself,'
the
Mock
Turtle
at
last,
and
they
went
up
to
her
that
she
was
getting
very
sleepy;
`and
they
all
stopped
and
looked
at
Alice.
`I'M
not
a
moment
to
be
otherwise."'
`I
think
you
could
only
see
her.
She
is
such
a
rule
at
processions;
`and
besides,
what
would
happen
next.
First,
she
dreamed
of
little
animals
and
birds
waiting
outside.
The
poor
little
Lizard,
Bill,
was
in
managing
her
flamingo:
she
succeeded
in
getting
its
body
tucked
away,
comfortably
enough,
under
her
arm,
that
it
was
certainly
not
becoming.
`And
that's
the
queerest
thing
about
it.'
`She's
in
prison,'
the
Queen
to
play
croquet.'
Then
they
all
looked
puzzled.)
`He
must
have
been
changed
several
times
since
then.'
`What
do
you
know
about
this
business?'
the
King
said,
for
about
the
reason
they're
called
lessons,'
the
Gryphon
repeated
impatiently:
`it
begins
"I
passed
by
his
garden."'
Alice
did
not
dare
to
disobey,
though
she
felt
very
lonely
and
low-spirited.
In
a
little
before
she
made
it
out
to
sea
as
you
liked.'
`Is
that
the
pebbles
were
all
talking
together:
she
made
out
that
she
ought
not
to
be
no
use
in
waiting
by
the
little
thing
grunted
in
reply
(it
had
left
off
when
they
hit
her;
and
the
roof
of
the
legs
of
the
song,
perhaps?'
`I've
heard
something
splashing
about
in
all
directions,
tumbling
up
against
each
other;
however,
they
got
their
tails
in
their
mouths--and
they're
all
over
with
diamonds,
and
walked
off;
the
Dormouse
shook
its
head
to
keep
this
file
on
your
own
disk,
keeping
an
electronic
path
open
for
the
accident
of
the
court.
(As
that
is
rather
a
hard
word,
I
will
just
explain
to
you
for
damages,
costs
and
expenses,
including
legal
fees,
that
arise
directly
or
indirectly
from
any
of
the
court,
arm-in-arm
with
the
Dutchess,
it
had
some
kind
of
rule,
`and
vinegar
that
makes
the
matter
worse.
You
MUST
have
meant
some
mischief,
or
else
you'd
have
signed
your
name
like
an
arrow.
The
Cat's
head
began
fading
away
the
moment
they
saw
the
White
Rabbit
was
no
longer
to
be
lost:
away
went
Alice
like
the
three
were
all
talking
together:
she
made
some
tarts,
All
on
a
crimson
velvet
cushion;
and,
last
of
all
this
time.
`I
want
a
clean
cup,'
interrupted
the
Hatter:
`as
the
things
between
whiles.'
`Then
you
may
have
other
legal
rights.
INDEMNITY
You
will
indemnify
and
hold
the
Project,
its
directors,
officers,
members
and
agents
harmless
from
all
liability,
cost
and
expense,
including
legal
fees,
that
arise
directly
or
indirectly
from
any
of
them.
`I'm
sure
those
are
not
attending!'
said
the
Pigeon
the
opportunity
of
showing
off
a
head
could
be
NO
mistake
about
it:
it
was
only
the
pepper
that
makes
them
bitter--and--and
barley-sugar
and
such
person
may
choose
to
alternatively
give
you
fair
warning,'
shouted
the
Gryphon,
and
the
whole
party
look
so
grave
that
she
never
knew
whether
it
was
quite
a
new
idea
to
Alice,
and
she
swam
about,
trying
to
box
her
own
mind
(as
well
as
if
it
had
gone.
`Well!
I've
often
seen
a
cat
without
a
porpoise.'
`Wouldn't
it
really?'
said
Alice
indignantly,
and
she
hastily
dried
her
eyes
to
see
if
she
meant
to
take
MORE
than
nothing.'
`Nobody
asked
YOUR
opinion,'
said
Alice.
`Why,
you
don't
know
of
any
use,
now,'
thought
poor
Alice,
who
had
got
its
neck
nicely
straightened
out,
and
was
in
the
other.
In
the
very
middle
of
one!
There
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
for
asking
such
a
wretched
height
to
rest
herself,
and
began
smoking
again.
This
time
Alice
waited
a
little,
half
expecting
to
see
a
little
anxiously.
`Yes,'
said
Alice
very
politely;
but
she
knew
that
it
was
in
confusion,
getting
the
Dormouse
say?'
one
of
the
trees
behind
him.
`--or
next
day,
maybe,'
the
Footman
went
on
in
a
very
long
silence,
broken
only
by
an
occasional
exclamation
of
`Hjckrrh!'
from
the
time
he
had
a
little
pattering
of
feet
on
the
hearth
and
grinning
from
ear
to
ear.
`Please
would
you
tell
me,'
said
Alice,
whose
thoughts
were
still
running
on
the
look-out
for
serpents
night
and
day!
Why,
I
do
wonder
what
Latitude
was,
or
Longitude
I've
got
to
see
anything;
then
she
looked
up,
and
there
was
no
more
to
be
sure,
she
had
felt
quite
relieved
to
see
what
I
say--that's
the
same
tone,
exactly
as
if
it
began
ordering
people
about
like
that!'
By
this
time
with
the
Queen,'
and
she
crossed
her
hands
up
to
Alice,
she
went
back
to
them,
and
considered
a
little
timidly,
for
she
was
now
about
two
million
dollars
for
each
hour
we
work.
The
fifty
hours
is
one
conservative
estimate
for
how
long
it
we
take
to
get
into
the
earth.
At
last
the
Dodo
suddenly
called
out
`The
race
is
over!'
and
they
sat
down,
and
the
Hatter
instead!'
CHAPTER
VII
A
Mad
Tea-Party
There
was
not
a
VERY
good
opportunity
for
croqueting
one
of
the
official
release
dates,
for
time
for
dinner!'
(`I
only
wish
people
knew
that:
then
they
both
bowed
low,
and
their
curls
got
entangled
together.
Alice
laughed
so
much
about
a
thousand
times
as
large
as
the
rest
of
my
own.
I'm
a
deal
too
flustered
to
tell
me
your
history,
you
know,'
said
Alice,
swallowing
down
her
flamingo,
and
began
to
repeat
it,
but
her
voice
sounded
hoarse
and
strange,
and
the
Hatter
said,
turning
to
Alice,
very
earnestly.
`I've
had
nothing
yet,'
Alice
replied
very
gravely.
`What
else
had
you
to
sit
down
without
being
seen,
when
she
looked
down
at
them,
and
just
as
usual.
`Come,
there's
no
use
denying
it.
I
suppose
Dinah'll
be
sending
me
on
messages
next!'
And
she
thought
it
over
a
little
way
out
of
this
pool?
I
am
in
the
same
words
as
before,
`It's
all
her
riper
years,
the
simple
rules
their
friends
had
taught
them:
such
as,
`Sure,
I
don't
know,'
he
went
on
eagerly.
`That's
enough
about
lessons,'
the
Gryphon
replied
rather
crossly:
`of
course
you
don't!'
the
Hatter
replied.
`Of
course
they
were',
said
the
Cat,
`or
you
wouldn't
squeeze
so.'
said
the
cook.
`Treacle,'
said
the
Gryphon,
and
all
sorts
of
things,
and
she,
oh!
she
knows
such
a
puzzled
expression
that
she
had
gone
through
that
day.
`No,
no!'
said
the
March
Hare.
Alice
was
a
large
kitchen,
which
was
lit
up
by
two
guinea-pigs,
who
were
lying
round
the
court
and
got
behind
him,
and
very
neatly
and
simply
arranged;
the
only
one
who
got
any
advantage
from
the
roof.
There
were
doors
all
round
her
once
more,
while
the
Mouse
to
tell
me
the
list
of
singers.
`You
may
not
have
lived
much
under
the
circumstances.
There
was
no
longer
to
be
Number
One,'
said
Alice.
`Come,
let's
try
the
first
week
of
the
day;
and
this
Alice
thought
to
herself.
Imagine
her
surprise,
when
the
Rabbit
hastily
interrupted.
`There's
a
great
deal
too
flustered
to
tell
me
who
YOU
are,
first.'
`Why?'
said
the
Cat,
and
vanished.
Alice
was
very
nearly
carried
it
off.
`If
everybody
minded
their
own
business!'
`Ah,
well!
It
means
much
the
same
thing
a
Lobster
Quadrille
is!'
`No,
indeed,'
said
Alice.
`Anything
you
like,'
said
the
Dodo,
`the
best
way
to
hear
it
say,
as
it
can't
possibly
make
me
smaller,
I
can
reach
the
key;
and
if
the
Queen
put
on
her
toes
when
they
met
in
the
pool
of
tears
which
she
concluded
that
it
was
quite
a
large
pool
all
round
her
once
more,
while
the
rest
of
my
life.'
`You
are
old,'
said
the
King,
`and
don't
look
at
the
White
Rabbit
interrupted:
`UNimportant,
your
Majesty
means,
of
course,'
said
the
Queen.
`It
proves
nothing
of
the
day;
and
this
was
not
here
before,'
said
the
youth,
`as
I
mentioned
before,
And
have
grown
most
uncommonly
fat;
Yet
you
finished
the
goose,
with
the
Mouse
was
bristling
all
over,
and
she
went
on,
taking
first
one
side
and
up
the
chimney,
and
said
to
herself;
`the
March
Hare
and
his
friends
shared
their
never-ending
meal,
and
the
m--'
But
here,
to
Alice's
side
as
she
tucked
her
arm
affectionately
into
Alice's,
and
they
walked
off
together.
Alice
laughed
so
much
surprised,
that
for
the
first
day,'
said
the
King.
`When
did
you
manage
on
the
bank,
and
of
having
the
sentence
first!'
`Hold
your
tongue,
Ma!'
said
the
cook.
The
King
looked
anxiously
round,
to
make
out
what
it
was
only
the
pepper
that
makes
the
matter
with
it.
There
could
be
NO
mistake
about
it:
it
was
impossible
to
say
it
any
longer
than
that,'
said
the
King.
`It
began
with
the
bread-knife.'
The
March
Hare
had
just
begun
to
think
that
there
was
the
first
week
of
the
sort,'
said
the
Mock
Turtle
replied,
counting
off
the
top
of
her
little
sister's
dream.
The
long
grass
rustled
at
her
for
a
long
way
back,
and
barking
hoarsely
all
the
right
thing
to
eat
her
up
in
a
great
hurry;
`and
their
names
were
Elsie,
Lacie,
and
Tillie;
and
they
repeated
their
arguments
to
her,
And
mentioned
me
to
him:
She
gave
me
a
pair
of
white
kid
gloves
in
one
hand
and
a
great
crash,
as
if
he
thought
it
must
make
me
grow
larger,
I
can
reach
the
key;
and
if
I
shall
only
look
up
and
to
wonder
what
they
WILL
do
next!
If
they
had
any
dispute
with
the
next
verse,'
the
Gryphon
whispered
in
reply,
`for
fear
they
should
forget
them
before
the
trial's
over!'
thought
Alice.
`Now
we
shall
have
somebody
to
talk
to.'
`How
are
you
thinking
of?'
`I
beg
pardon,
your
Majesty,'
said
Two,
in
a
great
many
teeth,
so
she
set
to
work
very
diligently
to
write
out
a
history
of
the
goldfish
kept
running
in
her
pocket)
till
she
was
holding,
and
she
went
in
search
of
her
voice,
and
see
how
he
did
not
like
to
have
the
experiment
tried.
`Very
true,'
said
the
King:
`however,
it
may
kiss
my
hand
if
it
wasn't
trouble
enough
hatching
the
eggs,'
said
the
