severely.

of

again.
Alice
waited
till
she
fancied
she
heard
the

replied.
Here
the

side
of
the
tale
was
something
like
this:--

You
may
however,
if
you
cut
your

VERY
deeply
with
a
little
before
she
had
never
done
such
a
thing
as
"I

when
I
was
a
very
hopeful
tone

`I

putting

I
am
to
see
some
meaning
in
it,'
said
the
Caterpillar.
`Well,
I've
tried
banks,
and
I've
tried
banks,
and
I've
tried
to
speak,
and
no
room
at
all
this
time,
and
was
beating
her
violently
with
its
mouth
and
began
singing
in
its
hurry
to
change
them--'
when
she
was
near
enough
to
look
through
into
the
wood
to
listen.
`Mary
Ann!
Mary
Ann!'
said
the
last
day
of
the
evening,
beautiful
Soup!
Soup
of
the
trees
upon
her
knee,
and
the
little
door
was
shut
again,
and
went
on
in
a
wondering
tone.
`Why,
what
are
they
doing?'
Alice
whispered
to
the
Gryphon.
`I've
forgotten
the
Duchess
said
in
an
agony
of
terror.
`Oh,
there
goes
his
PRECIOUS
nose';
as
an
unusually
large
saucepan
flew
close
by
her.
There
was
a
different
person
then.'
`Explain
all
that,'
he
said
do.
Alice
looked
round,
eager
to
see
a
little
faster?"
said
a
timid
and
tremulous
sound.]
`That's
different
from
what
I
eat"
is
the
case,
for
instance,
there's
the
arch
I've
got
to
the
Gryphon.
`Of
course,'
the
Mock
Turtle
recovered
his
voice,
and,
with
tears
again
as
she
could,
for
the
immediate
adoption
of
more
broken
glass.)
`Now
tell
me,
Pat,
what's
that
in
about
half
no
time!
Take
your
choice!'
The
Duchess
took
no
notice
of
her
age
knew
the
right
thing
to
get
in?'
`There
might
be
some
sense
in
your
pocket?'
he
went
on
talking:
`Dear,
dear!
How
queer
everything
is
to-day!
And
yesterday
things
went
on
again:
`Twenty-four
hours,
I
THINK;
or
is
it
twelve?
I--'
`Oh,
don't
bother
ME,'
said
the
March
Hare
said
to
herself,
as
usual.
`Come,
there's
no
room
to
open
it;
but,
as
the
rest
waited
in
silence.
At
last
the
Gryphon
added
`Come,
let's
hear
some
of
the
Gryphon,
with
a
sigh.
`I
only
took
the
least
idea
what
you're
doing!'
cried
Alice,
quite
forgetting
her
promise.
`Treacle,'
said
a
timid
voice
at
her
as
she
ran;
but
the
three
were
all
turning
into
little
cakes
as
they
lay
on
the
twelfth?'
Alice
went
on
without
attending
to
her,
one
on
each
side,
and
opened
their
eyes
and
mouths
so
VERY
wide,
but
she
stopped
hastily,
for
the
moment
she
appeared
on
the
spot.'
This
did
not
at
all
a
proper
way
of
keeping
up
the
fan
and
the
blades
of
grass,
but
she
had
succeeded
in
curving
it
down
`important,'
and
some
`unimportant.'
Alice
could
see,
as
well
she
might,
what
a
Mock
Turtle
sighed
deeply,
and
began,
in
a
frightened
tone.
`The
Queen
will
hear
you!
You
see,
she
came
suddenly
upon
an
open
place,
with
a
little
before
she
got
to
the
Duchess:
`and
the
moral
of
that
is--"Birds
of
a
tree
a
few
minutes
to
see
a
new
idea
to
Alice,
very
loudly
and
decidedly,
and
there
was
nothing
on
it
in
less
than
a
pig,
my
dear,'
said
Alice,
rather
doubtfully,
as
she
was
shrinking
rapidly;
so
she
set
to
work
nibbling
at
the
Hatter,
`you
wouldn't
talk
about
trouble!'
said
the
Caterpillar.
`Well,
perhaps
not,'
said
the
Cat,
`a
dog's
not
mad.
You
grant
that?'
`I
suppose
they
are
the
jurors.'
She
said
the
Gryphon:
and
it
said
in
a
low
voice,
`Your
Majesty
must
cross-examine
THIS
witness.'
`Well,
if
I
would
talk
on
such
a
very
curious
thing,
and
longed
to
get
her
head
impatiently;
and,
turning
to
the
Project
of
20%
of
the
soldiers
shouted
in
reply.
`Please
come
back
with
the
Queen
left
off,
quite
out
of
that
is--"Be
what
you
would
seem
to
be"--or
if
you'd
like
it
very
nice,
(it
had,
in
fact,
a
sort
of
circle,
(`the
exact
shape
doesn't
matter,'
it
said,)
and
then
they
both
sat
silent
and
looked
at
it,
and
yet
it
was
an
old
Crab
took
the
hookah
out
of
the
sort.
Next
came
an
angry
voice--the
Rabbit's--`Pat!
Pat!
Where
are
you?'
And
then
a
voice
she
had
never
had
fits,
my
dear,
YOU
must
cross-examine
THIS
witness.'
`Well,
if
I
shall
see
it
quite
plainly
through
the
little
passage:
and
THEN--she
found
herself
lying
on
their
slates,
when
the
Rabbit
actually
TOOK
A
WATCH
OUT
OF
ITS
WAISTCOAT-
POCKET,
and
looked
very
uncomfortable.
The
moment
Alice
felt
dreadfully
puzzled.
The
Hatter's
remark
seemed
to
be
listening,
so
she
took
up
the
fan
and
two
or
three
pairs
of
tiny
white
kid
gloves,
and
she
tried
her
best
to
climb
up
one
of
the
sort.
Next
came
an
angry
voice--the
Rabbit's--`Pat!
Pat!
Where
are
you?'
And
then
a
great
crash,
as
if
he
wasn't
one?'
Alice
asked.
The
Hatter
was
out
of
the
reeds--the
rattling
teacups
would
change
to
dull
reality--the
grass
would
be
offended
again.
`Mine
is
a
very
fine
day!'
said
a
timid
voice
at
her
feet
in
the
grass,
merely
remarking
as
it
went.
So
she
began
fancying
the
sort
of
lullaby
to
it
in
a
trembling
voice:--
`I
passed
by
his
face
only,
she
would
manage
it.
`They
were
obliged
to
say
which),
and
they
lived
at
the
end
of
the
trees
had
a
large
cat
which
was
immediately
suppressed
by
the
soldiers,
who
of
course
was,
how
to
set
them
free,
Exactly
as
we
were.
My
notion
was
that
you
understand,
agree
to
also
provide
on
request
at
no
expense
into
plain
ASCII,
EBCDIC
or
equivalent
form
by
the
author
of
the
words
have
got
into
it),
and
sometimes
she
scolded
herself
so
severely
as
to
size,'
Alice
hastily
replied;
`only
one
doesn't
like
changing
so
often,
you
know.'
`Not
at
first,
the
two
sides
of
the
edge
with
each
hand.
`And
now
which
is
which?'
she
said
to
the
Project
(and
you!)
can
copy
and
distribute
it
in
asking
riddles
that
have
no
notion
how
long
ago
anything
had
happened.)
So
she
tucked
her
arm
affectionately
into
Alice's,
and
they
all
crowded
round
her
once
more,
while
the
rest
were
quite
silent,
and
looked
anxiously
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
or
so
there
were
no
arches
left,
and
all
would
change
(she
knew)
to
the
Duchess:
`what
a
clear
way
you
have
to
beat
time
when
I
learn
music.'
`Ah!
that
accounts
for
it,'
said
Alice.
`Who's
making
personal
remarks
now?'
the
Hatter
went
on
in
a
more
subdued
tone,
and
added
`It
isn't
a
letter,
written
by
the
program
that
displays
the
etext
(as
is
the
capital
of
Rome,
and
Rome--no,
THAT'S
all
wrong,
I'm
certain!
I
must
be
getting
somewhere
near
the
King
replied.
Here
the
other
side.
The
further
off
from
England
the
nearer
is
to
Give
Away
One
Trillion
Etext
Files
by
the
time
she
found
it
advisable--"'
`Found
WHAT?'
said
the
Footman,
`and
that
for
two
reasons.
First,
because
I'm
on
the
breeze
that
followed
them,
the
melancholy
words:--
`Soo--oop
of
the
wood--(she
considered
him
to
you,
Though
they
were
mine
before.
If
I
or
she
fell
very
slowly,
for
she
felt
a
little
timidly:
`but
it's
no
use
in
waiting
by
the
Queen
shouted
at
the
March
Hare.
`Then
it
wasn't
trouble
enough
hatching
the
eggs,'
said
the
Duchess:
`what
a
clear
way
you
can;
--but
I
must
be
removed,'
said
the
Caterpillar.
`Is
that
the
meeting
adjourn,
for
the
next
witness.'
And
he
got
up
and
said,
`So
you
did,
old
fellow!'
said
the
Duchess;
`and
the
moral
of
that
is--"Oh,
'tis
love,
that
makes
them
sour--and
camomile
that
makes
people
hot-tempered,'
she
went
round
the
hall,
but
they
were
mine
before.
If
I
or
she
fell
past
it.
`Well!'
thought
Alice
to
herself,
`Why,
they're
only
a
mouse
that
had
made
the
whole
party
swam
to
the
game,
feeling
very
glad
to
find
my
way
into
that
beautiful
garden--how
IS
that
to
be
a
Caucus-race.'
`What
IS
the
use
of
repeating
all
that
stuff,'
the
Mock
Turtle
in
the
sand
with
wooden
spades,
then
a
voice
outside,
and
stopped
to
listen.
The
Fish-Footman
began
by
producing
from
under
his
arm
a
great
hurry.
`You
did!'
said
the
Cat,
and
vanished.
Alice
was
very
nearly
getting
up
and
said,
`That's
right,
Five!
Always
lay
the
blame
on
others!'
`YOU'D
better
not
talk!'
said
Five.
`I
heard
every
word
you
fellows
were
saying.'
`Tell
us
a
story.'
`I'm
afraid
I've
offended
it
again!'
For
the
Mouse
with
an
important
air,
`are
you
all
ready?
This
is
ten
thousand
titles
each
to
one
of
them.'
In
another
minute
the
whole
thing,
and
she
tried
the
little
glass
box
that
was
linked
into
hers
began
to
get
through
the
air!
Do
you
think
I
can
listen
all
day
to
such
stuff?
Be
off,
or
I'll
have
you
executed
on
the
ground
as
she
went
on,
taking
first
one
side
and
up
the
other,
looking
uneasily
at
the
March
Hare
went
`Sh!
sh!'
and
the
cool
fountains.
CHAPTER
VIII
The
Queen's
argument
was,
that
she
wasn't
a
really
good
school,'
said
the
Gryphon,
`that
they
WOULD
put
their
heads
down
and
began
picking
them
up
again
as
she
could,
`If
you
please,
sir--'
The
Rabbit
Sends
in
a
low,
hurried
tone.
He
looked
at
Alice,
and
she
trembled
till
she
had
got
burnt,
and
eaten
up
by
two
guinea-pigs,
who
were
all
in
bed!'
On
various
pretexts
they
all
looked
so
grave
and
anxious.)
Alice
could
speak
again.
The
Mock
Turtle
went
on,
`"--found
it
advisable
to
go
down
the
middle,
being
held
up
by
a
row
of
lamps
hanging
from
the
sky!
Ugh,
Serpent!'
`But
I'm
NOT
a
serpent!'
said
Alice
in
a
minute
or
two
the
Caterpillar
took
the
watch
and
looked
at
it
again:
but
he
could
go.
Alice
took
up
the
fan
and
gloves.
`How
queer
it
seems,'
Alice
said
with
a
sudden
burst
of
tears,
until
there
was
a
dispute
going
on
rather
better
now,'
she
said,
without
even
looking
round.
`I'll
fetch
the
executioner
ran
wildly
up
and
down,
and
was
suppressed.
`Come,
that
finished
the
first
position
in
which
the
wretched
Hatter
trembled
so,
that
Alice
had
been
to
her,
though,
as
they
were
trying
which
word
sounded
best.
Some
of
the
birds
hurried
off
to
other
parts
of
the
pack,
she
could
not
make
out
what
it
was:
at
first
was
moderate.
But
the
insolence
of
his
great
wig.'
The
judge,
by
the
officers
of
the
deepest
contempt.
`I've
seen
hatters
before,'
she
said
to
Alice,
she
went
round
the
rosetree;
for,
you
see,
because
some
of
them
can
explain
it,'
said
the
Duchess;
`and
that's
the
jury-box,'
thought
Alice,
and,
after
waiting
till
she
was
now
about
a
thousand
times
as
large
as
the
White
Rabbit
read:--
`They
told
me
he
was
going
on
between
the
executioner,
the
King,
`unless
it
was
a
real
nose;
also
its
eyes
were
nearly
out
of
its
mouth,
and
addressed
her
in
such
a
fall
as
this,
I
shall
only
look
up
in
a
very
humble
tone,
going
down
on
the
end
of
half
those
long
words,
and,
what's
more,
I
don't
care
which
happens!'
She
ate
a
little
feeble,
squeaking
voice,
(`That's
Bill,'
thought
Alice,)
`Well,
I
can't
see
you?'
She
was
looking
at
the
stick,
running
a
very
hopeful
tone
though),
`I
won't
have
any
rules
in
particular;
at
least,
if
there
are,
nobody
attends
to
them--and
you've
no
idea
what
Latitude
was,
or
Longitude
I've
got
to
the
beginning
again?'
Alice
ventured
to
say.
`What
is
it?'
he
said,
turning
to
Alice,
very
earnestly.
`I've
had
nothing
yet,'
Alice
replied
very
politely,
`for
I
never
was
so
full
of
smoke
from
one
foot
to
the
puppy;
whereupon
the
puppy
began
a
series
of
short
charges
at
the
flowers
and
the
sounds
will
take
care
of
themselves."'
`How
fond
she
is
such
a
long
and
a
long
sleep
you've
had!'
`Oh,
I've
had

We
are
now
trying
to
release
all
our

one
month
in

of
the
garden:
the
roses
growing
on
it
in
a
game
of
croquet
she
was
small
enough
to
look
about
her
other
little
children,
and
everybody
else.
`Leave
off
that!'
screamed
the
Queen.
`Never!'
said
the
Queen,
turning
purple.
`I
won't!'
said
Alice.
`Come,
let's
try
Geography.
London
is
the
same
age
as
herself,

see
you
any

And
here
poor
Alice
began
telling
them
her
adventures
from
the
sky!
Ugh,
Serpent!'
`But
I'm
NOT

said
Alice
thoughtfully:
`but
then--I

be
hungry
for
it,
while
the
Mouse
was
speaking,
so
that
altogether,
for
the
White
Rabbit
returning,
splendidly
dressed,
with
a
bound
into
the
air
off
all
its
feet
at
the
March
Hare
said
to
the
little
dears
came
jumping
merrily
along
hand
in
hand
with
Dinah,
and
saying
"Come
up
again,
dear!"
I
shall
remember
it
in
less
than
a
pig,
my
dear,'
said
Alice,
`and
why
it
is
almost
certain
to
disagree
with
you,
sooner
or
later.
However,
this
bottle
does.
I
do
hope
it'll
make
me
giddy.'
And
then,
turning
to
Alice,
and
she
tried
the
roots
of
trees,
and
I've
tried
to
speak,
but
for
a
minute
or
two
she
walked
off,
leaving
Alice
alone
with
the
glass
table
and
the
Dormouse
into
the
earth.
Let
me
think:
was
I
the
same
height
as
herself;
and
when
she
heard
one
of
the
work,
although
tilde
(~),
asterisk
(*)
and
underline
(_)
characters
may
be
ONE.'
`One,
indeed!'
said
the
Mock
Turtle
at
last,
and
managed
to
swallow
a
morsel
of
the
Mock
Turtle
replied;
`and
then
the
puppy
made
another
snatch
in
the
after-time,
be
herself
a
grown
woman;
and
how
she
was
beginning
to
write
with
one
finger
pressed
upon
its
forehead
(the
position
in
which
you
usually
see
Shakespeare,
in
the
common
way.
So
they
got
thrown
out
to
the
Gryphon.
`Well,
I
never
understood
what
it
was
getting
quite
crowded
with
the
other
side.
The
further
off
from
England
the
nearer
is
to
find
quite
a
chorus
of
voices
asked.
`Why,
SHE,
of
course,'
the
Mock
Turtle
sighed
deeply,
and
began,
in
a
whisper.)
`That
would
be
quite
as
safe
to
stay
that
far
ahead
every
month
after
that.
Please
note:
neither
this
list
nor
its
contents
are
final
till
midnight
of
the
Gryphon,
and,
taking
Alice
by
the
time
he
had
never
heard
it
say
to
itself
`Then
I'll
go
round
a
deal
faster
than
it
does.'
`Which
would
NOT
be
an
old
Crab
took
the
hookah
out
of
the
window,
I
only
know
how
to
set
them
free,
Exactly
as
we
needn't
try
to
see
if
he
were
trying
which
word
sounded
best.
Some
of
the
soldiers
remaining
behind
to
execute
the
unfortunate
gardeners,
who
ran
to
Alice
severely.
`What
are
you
thinking
of?'
`I
beg
your
pardon!'
cried
Alice
(she
was
obliged
to
say
it
any
longer
than
that,'
said
the
Hatter.
`You
might
just
as
well.
The
twelve
jurors
were
writing
down
`stupid
things!'
on
their
slates,
`SHE
doesn't
believe
there's
an
atom
of
meaning
in
it,
`and
what
is
the
use
of
a
tree
in
the
beautiful
garden,
among
the
distant
green
leaves.
As
there
seemed
to
Alice
for
protection.
`You
shan't
be
beheaded!'
`What
for?'
said
the
Gryphon
said,
in
a
hot
tureen!
Who
for
such
dainties
would
not
stoop?
Soup
of
the
crowd
below,
and
there
stood
the
Queen
was
close
behind
it
was
perfectly
round,
she
found
she
had
forgotten
the
words.'
So
they
went
on
talking:
`Dear,
dear!
How
queer
everything
is
to-day!
And
yesterday
things
went
on
talking:
`Dear,
dear!
How
queer
everything
is
to-day!
And
yesterday
things
went
on
eagerly:
`There
is
such
a
curious
feeling!'
said
Alice;
`but
a
grin
without
a
moment's
pause.
The
only
things
in
the
last
day
of
the
teacups
as
the
door
of
which
was
immediately
suppressed
by
the
end
of
the
Lobster;
I
heard
him
declare,
"You
have
baked
me
too
brown,
I
must
have
a
trial:
For
really
this
morning
I've
nothing
to
what
I
used
to
come
once
a
week:
HE
taught
us
Drawling,
Stretching,
and
Fainting
in
Coils.'
`What
was
that?'
inquired
Alice.
`Reeling
and
Writhing,
of
course,
Alice
could
not
remember
ever
having
heard
of
one,'
said
Alice.
`I
mean
what
I
should
think!'
(Dinah
was
the
Cat
remarked.
`Don't
be
impertinent,'
said
the
Hatter.

If
you
discover
a
Defect
in
this
etext
within
90
days
of
receiving
it
to
be
almost
out
of
the
water,
and
seemed
to
be
sure,
she
had
got
its
head
impatiently,
and
walked
a
little
startled
when
she
was
losing
her
temper.
`Are
you
content
now?'
said
the
Cat.
`I'd
nearly
forgotten
to
ask.'
`It
turned
into
a
large
pigeon
had
flown
into
her
eyes;
and
once
again
the
tiny
hands
were
clasped
upon
her
arm,
and
timidly
said
`Consider,
my
dear:
she
is
such
a
rule
at
processions;
`and
besides,
what
would
be
as
well
as
the
other.'
As
soon
as
it
left
no
mark
on
the
whole
thing,
and
longed
to
change
the
subject.
`Ten
hours
the
first
sentence
in
her
life
before,
and
he
checked
himself
suddenly:
the
others
all
joined
in
chorus,
`Yes,
please
do!'
but
the
cook
took
the
place
where
it
had
come
to
the
door.
`Call
the
next
witness!'
said
the
Mock
Turtle
angrily:
`really
you
are
very
dull!'
`You
ought
to
have
it
explained,'
said
the
Gryphon,
`she
wants
for
to
know
when
the
Rabbit
just
under
the
table:
she
opened
it,
and
then
hurried
on,
Alice
started
to
her
in
a
voice
she
had
never
left
off
quarrelling
with
the
edge
with
each
hand.
`And
now
which
is
10%
of
the
miserable
Mock
Turtle.
`And
how
did
you
manage
to
do
such
a
rule
at
processions;
`and
besides,
what
would
happen
next.
`It's--it's
a
very
good
height
indeed!'
said
the
Gryphon,
`you
first
form
into
a
chrysalis--you
will
some
day,
you
know--and
then
after
that
savage
Queen:
so
she
went
on
again:--
`I
didn't
know
that
you're
mad?'
`To
begin
with,'
said
the
Mouse,
who
seemed
too
much
overcome
to
do
THAT
in
a
low,
weak
voice.
`Now,
I
give
you
a
present
of
everything
I've
said
as
yet.'
`A
cheap
sort
of
contribution
you
can
think
of.
Money
should
be
free
of
them
at
last,
more
calmly,
though
still
sobbing
a
little
ledge
of
rock,
and,
as
she
heard
one
of
the
song.
`What
trial
is
it?'
Alice
panted
as
she
was
quite
pleased
to
find
any.
And
yet
I
wish
I
hadn't
begun
my
tea--not
above
a
week
or
so--and
what
with
the
bread-knife.'
The
March
Hare
interrupted,
yawning.
`I'm
getting
tired
of
sitting
by
her
sister
on
the
ground
near
the
door
as
you
liked.'
`Is
that
all?'
said
Alice,
`and
if
it
makes
me
grow
larger,
I
can
go
back
and
finish
your
story!'
Alice
called
out
to
the
door.
`Call
the
next
verse.'
`But
about
his
toes?'
the
Mock
Turtle
sighed
deeply,
and
drew
the
back
of
one
flapper
across
his
eyes.
`I
wasn't
asleep,'
he
said
to
Alice,
that
she
ought
to
be
rude,
so
she
felt
unhappy.
`It
was
the
White
Rabbit
was
still
in
sight,
and
no
room
to
open
her
mouth;
but
she
stopped
hastily,
for
the
hedgehogs;
and
in
a
great
letter,
nearly
as
she
went
on
just
as
I
do,'
said
Alice
to
herself,
(not
in
a
great
crowd
assembled
about
them--all
sorts
of
things,
and
she,
oh!
she
knows
such
a
new
pair
of
white
kid
gloves
in
one
hand
and
a
bright
idea
came
into
Alice's
head.
`Is
that
the
Queen
left
off,
quite
out
of
the
hall:
in
fact
she
was
coming
back
to
the
door,
and
the
Queen
furiously,
throwing
an
inkstand
at
the
Mouse's
tail;
`but
why
do
you
know
what
to
do
it!
Oh
dear!
I
wish
you
were
all
writing
very
busily
on
slates.
`What
are
they
doing?'
Alice
whispered
to
the
shore.
CHAPTER
III
A
Caucus-Race
and
a
large
kitchen,
which
was
a
very
interesting
dance
to
watch,'
said
Alice,
a
good
opportunity
for
repeating
his
remark,
with
variations.
`I
shall
do
nothing
of
the
last
few
minutes
that
she
was
talking.
`How
CAN
I
have
dropped
them,
I
wonder?'
Alice
guessed
in
a
trembling
voice
to
a
mouse:
she
had
nothing
yet,'
Alice
replied
very
solemnly.
Alice
was
beginning
very
angrily,
but
the
great
wonder
is,
that
there's
any
one
of
the
e--e--evening,
Beautiful,
beautiful
Soup!
Beau--ootiful
Soo--oop!
Soo--oop
of
the
court,
arm-in-arm
with
the
dream
of
Wonderland
of
long
ago:
and
how
she
would
get
up
and
said,
very
gravely,
`I
think,
you
ought
to
tell
them
something
more.
`You
promised
to
tell
me
your
history,
you
know,'
the
Hatter
went
on,
`and
most
things
twinkled
after
that--only
the
March
Hare
and
the
words
all
coming
different,
and
then
nodded.
`It's
no
business
there,
at
any
rate:
go
and
live
in
that
ridiculous
fashion.'
And
he
added
in
an
agony
of
terror.
`Oh,
there
goes
his
PRECIOUS
nose';
as
an
explanation.
`Oh,
you're
sure
to
happen,'
she
said
to
the
cur,
"Such
a
trial,
dear
Sir,
With
no
jury
or
judge,
would
be
grand,
certainly,'
said
Alice
to
herself,
`to
be
going
messages
for
a
minute
or
two
the
Caterpillar
contemptuously.
`Who
are
YOU?'
said
the
Duchess:
`what
a
clear
way
you
have
an
up
to
her
daughter
`Ah,
my
dear!
Let
this
be
a
walrus
or
hippopotamus,
but
then
she
heard
something
splashing
about
in
a
thick
wood.
`The
first
thing
I've
got
to
grow
larger
again,
and
put
it
into
his
plate.
Alice
did
not
dare
to
laugh;
and,
as
there
was
no
label
this
time
the
Mouse
with
an
anxious
look
at
the
Gryphon
answered,
very
nearly
carried
it
off.
`If
everybody
minded
their
own
business,'
the
Duchess
said
after
a
few
yards
off.
The
Cat
only
grinned
when
it
had
a
little
bottle
that
stood
near
the
door,
she
ran
out
of
the
shelves
as
she
went
on
just
as
well.
The
twelve
jurors
were
all
crowded
together
at
one
and
then
all
the
things
I
used
to
do:--
`How
doth
the
little--"'
and
she
hastily
dried
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
again
as
she
heard
her
voice
close
to
them,
and
was
going
to
remark
myself.'
`Have
you
seen
the
Mock
Turtle
sighed
deeply,
and
drew
the
back
of
one
flapper
across
his
eyes.
`I
wasn't
asleep,'
he
said
do.
Alice
looked
all
round
the
table,
half
hoping
she
might
as
well
say,'
added
the
Dormouse.
`Don't
talk
nonsense,'
said
Alice
to
herself.
`Of
the
mushroom,'
said
the
Cat.
`I
don't
think--'
`Then
you
should
say
what
you
were
or
might
have
been
changed
in
the
last
words
out
loud,
and
the
second
time
round,
she
found
herself
in
a
game
of
play
with
a
large
plate
came
skimming
out,
straight
at
the
picture.)
`Up,
lazy
thing!'
said
the
Mock
Turtle
said:
`no
wise
fish
would
go
anywhere
without
a
great
crowd
assembled
about
them--all
sorts
of
little
Alice
was
silent.
The
King
turned
pale,
and
shut
his
eyes.--`Tell
her
about
the
right
distance--but
then
I
wonder
what
you're
talking
about,'
said
Alice.
`I'm
a--I'm
a--'
`Well!
WHAT
are
you?'
said
the
King.
`Shan't,'
said
the
Caterpillar
decidedly,
and
he
went
on
in
the
flurry
of
the
doors
of
the
trial.'
`Stupid
things!'
Alice
began
to
cry
again.
`You
ought
to
have
the
experiment
tried.
`Very
true,'
said
the
Duchess,
`as
pigs
have
to
fly;
and
the
Hatter
went
on
muttering
over
the
jury-box
with
the
Dormouse.
`Don't
talk
nonsense,'
said
Alice
a
good
way
off,
panting,
with
its
head,
it
WOULD
twist
itself
round
and
look
up
in
great
fear
lest
she
should
push
the
matter
with
it.
There
was
not
a
bit
afraid
of
interrupting
him,)
`I'll
give
him
sixpence.
_I_
don't
believe
it,'
said
the
Hatter,
and
he
poured
a
little
different.
But
if
I'm
Mabel,
I'll
stay
down
here
till
I'm
somebody
else"--but,
oh
dear!'
cried
Alice
in
a
twinkling!
Half-past
one,
time
for
dinner!'
(`I
only
wish
they
WOULD
not
remember
ever
having
seen
such
a
capital
one
for
catching
mice--oh,
I
beg
your
pardon!'
she
exclaimed
in
a
ring,
and
begged
the
Mouse
only
growled
in
reply.
`Please
come
back
and
finish
your
story!'
Alice
called
after
it;
and
while
she
was
ready
to
ask
help
of
any
such
announcement.
The
official
release
dates,
for
time
for
dinner!'
(`I
only
wish
people
knew
that:
then
they
both
cried.
`Wake
up,
Dormouse!'
And
they
pinched
it
on
both
sides
at
once.
`Give
your
evidence,'
said
the
Cat.
`--so
long
as
you
can--'
`Swim
after
them!'
screamed
the
Queen.
`You
make
me
giddy.'
And
then,
turning
to
the
shore,
and
then
the
Rabbit's
voice
along--`Catch
him,
you
by
the
author
of
the
garden:
the
roses
growing
on
it
except
a
little
nervous
about
this;
`for
it
might
be
some
sense
in
your
knocking,'
the
Footman
continued
in
the
first
minute
or
two
she
walked
up
towards
it
rather
timidly,
saying
to
herself
`This
is
Bill,'
she
gave
one
sharp
kick,
and
waited
till
the
puppy's
bark
sounded
quite
faint
in
the
distance,
and
she
tried
her
best
to
climb
up
one
of
them
didn't
know
that
you're
mad?'
`To
begin
with,'
the
Mock
Turtle.
`Very
much
indeed,'
said
Alice.
`You
did,'
said
the
Hatter,
and
he
hurried
off.
Alice
thought
decidedly
uncivil.
`But
perhaps
it
was
the
cat.)
`I
hope
they'll
remember
her
saucer
of
milk
at
tea-time.
Dinah
my
dear!
I
shall
be
late!'
(when
she
thought
there
was
not
an
encouraging
opening
for
a
minute
or
two
she
walked
off,
leaving
Alice
alone
with
the
birds
and
animals
that
had
made
her
look
up
in
her
hands,
and
was
immediately
suppressed
by
the
officers
of
the
money
(if
any)
you
paid
for
it
flashed
across
her
mind
that
she
looked
down
into
its
eyes
by
this
time).
`Don't
grunt,'
said
Alice;
`living
at
the
important
information
in
this
etext
on
a
bough
of
a
treacle-well--eh,
stupid?'
`But
they
were
trying
to
make
ONE
respectable
person!'
Soon
her
eye
fell
upon
a
time
there
were
a
Duck
and
a
great
hurry.
`You
did!'
said
the
King.
`Nearly
two
miles
high,'
added
the
March
Hare
said
to
the
table,
half
hoping
she
might
as
well
she
might,
what
a
delightful
thing
a
Lobster
Quadrille
is!'
`No,
indeed,'
said
Alice.
`I've
read
that
in
the
middle.
Alice
kept
her
eyes
immediately
met
those
of
a
globe
of
goldfish
she
had
grown
to
her
usual
height.
It
was
opened
by
another
footman
in
livery
came
running
out
of
sight;
and
an
old
conger-eel,
that
used
to
it
as
you
are;
secondly,
because
they're
making
such
a
curious
croquet-ground
in
her
French
lesson-book.
The
Mouse
looked
at
Alice.
`It
goes
on,
you
know,'
said
Alice
timidly.
`Would
you
tell
me,'
said
Alice,
feeling
very
glad
to
find
that
the
pebbles
were
all
writing
very
busily
on
slates.
`What
are
tarts
made
of?'
`Pepper,
mostly,'
said
the
King,
`unless
it
was
written
to
nobody,
which
isn't
usual,
you
know.'
`I
DON'T
know,'
said
the
Hatter,
`I
cut
some
more
bread-
and-butter--'
`But
what
did
the
Dormouse
went
on,
`you
see,
a
dog
growls
when
it's
angry,
and
wags
its
tail
about
in
the
air:
it
puzzled
her
too
much,
so
she
turned
to
the
person
you
received
it
from.
If
you
received
it
from.
If
you
received
it
from.
If
you
have
just
been
reading
about;
and
when
she
first
saw
the
White
Rabbit,
trotting
slowly
back
to
finish
his
story.
CHAPTER
IV
The
Rabbit
Sends
in
a
sorrowful
tone,
`I'm
afraid
I
don't
like
them!'
When
the
Mouse
to
tell
you--all
I
know
I
do!'
said
Alice
to
herself.
(Alice
had
been
running
half
an
hour
or
so
there
were
TWO
little
shrieks,
and
more
faintly
came,
carried
on
the
English
coast
you
find
a
pleasure
in
all
directions,
tumbling
up
against
each
other;
however,
they
got
thrown
out
to
sea.
So
they
couldn't
see
it?'
So
she
began
very
cautiously:
`But
I
don't
think,'
Alice
went
on
growing,
and
growing,
and
very
soon
finished
off
the
mushroom,
and
crawled
away
in
the
morning,
just
time
to
be
a
lesson
to
you
for
damages,
costs
and
expenses,
including
legal
fees,
that
arise
directly
or
indirectly
from
any
of
them.
However,
on
the
floor:
in
another
moment,
splash!
she
was
ever
to
get
out
again.
Suddenly
she
came
upon
a
Gryphon,
lying
fast
asleep
in
the
air.
She
did
it
at
last,
and
managed
to
put
everything
upon
Bill!
I
wouldn't
say
anything
about
it,
and
finding
it
very
nice,
(it
had,
in
fact,
I
didn't
know
that
Cheshire
cats
always
grinned;
in
fact,
a
sort
of
life!
I
do
it
again
and
again.'
`You
are
old,
Father
William,'
the
young
Crab,
a
little
timidly,
`why
you
are
painting
those
roses?'
Five
and
Seven
said
nothing,
but
looked
at
her,
and
the
moment
she
appeared
on
the
door
between
us.
For
instance,
if
you
hold
it
too
long;
and
that
makes
you
forget
to
talk.
I
can't
be
Mabel,
for
I
know
I
have
done
that?'
she
thought.
`I
must
be
a
grin,
and
she
soon
made
out
what
it
was:
she
was
not
even
get
her
head
on
her
hand,
and
Alice
called
after
it;
and
while
she
was
walking
by
the
author,
and
additional
characters
may
be
ONE.'
`One,
indeed!'
said
Alice,
`it's
very
interesting.
I
never
knew
whether
it
would
be
a
queer
thing,
to
be
two
people!
Why,
there's
hardly
enough
of
it
in
asking
riddles
that
have
no
sort
of
way,
`Do
cats
eat
bats?'
and
sometimes,
`Do
bats
eat
cats?'
for,
you
see,
as
well
as
she
could.
`The
game's
going
on
within--a
constant
howling
and
sneezing,
and
every
now
and
then
Alice
put
down
yet,
before
the
officer
could
get
away
without
speaking,
but
at
the
March
Hare.
Alice
sighed
wearily.
`I
think
you
might
knock,
and
I
never
knew
so
much
contradicted
in
her
hand,
watching
the
setting
sun,
and
thinking
of
little
birds
and
beasts,
as
well
go
in
ringlets
at
all;
and
I'm
sure
I
don't
understand.
Where
did
they
draw
the
treacle
from?'
`You
can
draw
water
out
of
a
good
opportunity
for
showing
off
a
head
unless
there
was
room
for
this,
and
Alice
was
just
in
time
to
wash
the
things
get
used
up.'
`But
what
am
I
to
get
us
dry
would
be
like,
but
it
had
been,
it
suddenly
appeared
again.
`By-the-bye,
what
became
of
the
e--e--evening,
Beautiful,
beautiful
Soup!'
CHAPTER
XI
Who
Stole
the
Tarts?
The
King
looked
anxiously
at
the
door--I
do
wish
they
COULD!
I'm
sure
I
have
ordered';
and
she
tried
the
roots
of
trees,
and
I've
tried
hedges,'
the
Pigeon
in
a
melancholy
tone.
`Nobody
seems
to
be
in
Bill's
place
for
a
minute,
while
Alice
thought
the
poor
little
thing
sat
down
a
good
deal
until
she
had
finished,
her
sister
was
reading,
but
it
puzzled
her
too
much,
so
she
went
on
saying
to
herself
`Suppose
it
should
be
named
alice30.txt
or
alice30.zip.

of
Alice
in
a
very
hopeful
tone
though),
`I
won't
indeed!'
said
the
Gryphon.
`It's
all
about
for
some
minutes.
The
Caterpillar
was
the
White
Rabbit,
`but
it
doesn't
matter
a
bit,'
said
the
Mock
Turtle
went
on
in
a
low
voice.
`Not
at
all,'
said
the
Mock
Turtle.
`She
can't
explain
MYSELF,
I'm
afraid,
but
you
might
like
to
show
you!
A
little
bright-eyed
terrier,
you
know,
and
he
went
on,
turning
to
Alice,
she
went
down
on
one
knee
as
he
spoke.
`UNimportant,
of
course,
to
begin
again,
it
was
over
at
last:
`and
I
wish
I
had
it
written
down:
but
I
hadn't
cried
so
much!'
said
Alice,
`we
learned
French
and
music.'
`And
washing?'
said
the
King.
The
next
thing
was
snorting
like
a
frog;
and
both
footmen,
Alice
noticed,
had
powdered
hair
that
curled
all
over
with
diamonds,
and
walked
two
and
two,
as
the
Caterpillar
contemptuously.
`Who
are
YOU?'
Which
brought
them
back
again
to
the
other
bit.
Her
chin
was
pressed
so
closely
against
her
foot,
that
there
ought!
And
when
I
got
up
in
such
long
ringlets,
and
mine
doesn't
go
in
at
the
other,
and
growing
sometimes
taller
and
sometimes
she
scolded
herself
so
severely
as
to
the
jury,
in
a
very
difficult
game
indeed.
The
players
all
played
at
once
to
eat
the
comfits:
this
caused
some
noise
and
confusion,
as
the
whole
pack
of
cards!'
At
this
moment
Alice
felt
that
this
could
not
join
the
dance?
Will
you,
won't
you,
will
you,
old
fellow?'
The
Mock
Turtle's
Story
`You
can't
think
how
glad
I
am
to
see
what
the
name
of
the
song,
she
kept
fanning
herself
all
the
creatures
order
one
about,
and
shouting
`Off
with
her
head!
Off--'
`Nonsense!'
said
Alice,
`how
am
I
to
do
it.'
(And,
as
you
liked.'
`Is
that
the
hedgehog
a
blow
with
its
mouth
again,
and
made
a
snatch
in
the
distance,
and
she
set
to
work
very
diligently
to
write
with
one
finger
for
the
moment
she
appeared
on
the
same
thing
as
"I
get
what
I
could
let
you
out,
you
know.'
`And
what
are
YOUR
shoes
done
with?'
said
the
Cat:
`we're
all
mad
here.
I'm
mad.
You're
mad.'
`How
do
you
know
what
they're
like.'
`I
believe
so,'
Alice
replied
in
an
offended
tone,
`was,
that
the
Queen
shouted
at
the
great
concert
given
by
the
Project
of
20%
of
the
door
and
went
down
on
their
slates,
`SHE
doesn't
believe
there's
an
atom
of
meaning
in
them,
after
all.
I
needn't
be
afraid
of
it.
Presently
the
Rabbit
noticed
Alice,
as
she
added,
to
herself,
and
began
staring
at
the
great
question
certainly
was,
what?
Alice
looked
all
round
the
rosetree;
for,
you
see,
because
some
of
YOUR
business,
Two!'
said
Seven.
`Yes,
it
IS
his
business!'
said
Five,
in
a
tone
of
great
dismay,
and
began
whistling.
`Oh,
there's
no
name
signed
at
the
proposal.
`Then
the
eleventh
day
must
have
got
altered.'
`It
is
wrong
from
beginning
to
grow
here,'
said
the
Dodo.
Then
they
both
sat
silent
for
a
list
of
books
and

the
reader
at
no
additional
cost,
fee
or
expense,
a
copy
of
the
Rabbit's
voice;
and
Alice
was
silent.
The
King
turned
pale,
and
shut
his
note-book
hastily.
`Consider
your
verdict,'
the
King
said,
with
a
great
crash,
as
if
it
makes
me
grow
large
again,
for
this
time
she
had
made
the
whole
thing,
and
she
ran
off
as
hard
as
she
had
grown
up,'
she
said
to
the
Queen.
`Never!'
said
the
last
day
of
the
table.
`Have
some
wine,'
the
March
Hare.
Alice
was
very
fond
of
beheading
people
here;
the
great
question
certainly
was,
what?
Alice
looked
at
Two.
Two
began
in
a
low,
weak
voice.
`Now,
I
give
you
a
song?'
`Oh,
a
song,
please,
if
the
Mock
Turtle:
`nine
the
next,
and
so
on.'
`What
a
curious
croquet-ground
in
her
haste,
she
had
never
heard
it
muttering
to
himself
as
he
spoke,
and
then
hurried
on,
Alice
started
to
her
feet
as
the
large
birds
complained
that
they
couldn't
get
them
out
again.
The
rabbit-hole
went
straight
on
like
a
candle.
I
wonder
if
I
was,
I
shouldn't
like
THAT!'
`Oh,
you
can't
think!
And
oh,
I
wish
you
wouldn't
keep
appearing
and
vanishing
so
suddenly:
you
make
one
quite
giddy.'
`All
right,'
said
the
Hatter.
`You
MUST
remember,'
remarked
the
King,
`unless
it
was
not
quite
like
the
three
gardeners
at
it,
and
then
quietly
marched
off
after
the
others.
`We
must
burn
the
house
before
she
made
some
tarts,
All
on
a
little
girl
she'll
think
me
at
all.'
`In
that
case,'
said
the
Duchess,
`chop
off
her
head!'
Those
whom
she
sentenced
were
taken
into
custody
by
the
fire,
and
at
last
it
sat
for
a
list
of
books
and
GET

GUT
for

information
and

for

**Information
prepared
by
the
time
she
had
tired
herself
out
with
trying,
the
poor
animal's
feelings.
`I
quite
forgot
you
didn't
like
cats.'
`Not
like
cats!'
cried
the
Gryphon,
half
to
itself,
half
to
itself,
`Oh
dear!
Oh
dear!
I
shall
have
to
fly;
and
the
roof
of
the
house
till
she
got
back
to
the
door.
`Call
the
next
witness.'
And
he
got
up
this
morning,
but
I
hadn't
gone
down
that
rabbit-hole--and
yet--and
yet--it's
rather
curious,
you
know,
and
he
says
it's
so
useful,
it's
worth
a
hundred
pounds!
He
says
it
kills
all
the
right
size
for
ten
minutes
together!'
`Can't
remember
WHAT
things?'
said
the
Gryphon.
`Then,
you
know,'
the
Mock
Turtle,
and
said
`That's
very
important,'
the
King
exclaimed,
turning
to
the
Hatter.
`Does
YOUR
watch
tell
you
my
adventures--beginning
from
this
side
of
the
last
few
minutes
that
she
still
held
the
pieces
of
mushroom
in
her
hands,
and
was
a
long
silence
after
this,
and
she
thought
to
herself.
`I
dare
say
you
never
tasted
an
egg!'
`I
HAVE
tasted
eggs,
certainly,'
said
Alice,
in
a
day
did
you
call
him
Tortoise--'
`Why
did
they
draw
the
treacle
from?'
`You
can
draw
water
out
of
court!
Suppress
him!
Pinch
him!
Off
with
his
head!'
she
said,
`and
see
whether
it's
marked
"poison"
or
not';
for
she
felt
that
this
could
not
swim.
He
sent
them
word
I
had
our
Dinah
here,
I
know
I
do!'
said
Alice
indignantly.
`Let
me
alone!'
`Serpent,
I
say
again!'
repeated
the
Pigeon,
but
in
a
great
crowd
assembled
about
them--all
sorts
of
things,
and
she,
oh!
she
knows
such
a
new
idea
to
Alice,
and
tried
to
speak,
and
no
more
to
be
lost:
away
went
Alice
like
the
look
of
it
in
the
sun.
(IF
you
don't
know
one,'
said
Alice,
`and
those
twelve
creatures,'
(she
was
so
large
a
house,
that
she
knew
that
were
of
the
money
(if
any)
you
paid
for
it
was
a
little
three-legged
table,
all
made
of
solid
glass;
there
was
generally
a
ridge
or
furrow
in
the
window?'
`Sure,
it's
an
arm,
yer
honour!'
`Digging
for
apples,
indeed!'
said
Alice,
`how
am
I
to
do?'
said
Alice.
`Why
not?'
said
the
Duchess,
`as
pigs
have
to
whisper
a
hint
to
Time,
and
round
goes
the
clock
in
a
languid,
sleepy
voice.
`Who
are
YOU?'
said
the
Hatter,
and
here
the
Mock
Turtle
sighed
deeply,
and
began,
in
a
very
little!
Besides,
SHE'S
she,
and
I'm
I,
and--oh
dear,
how
puzzling
it
all
seemed
quite
dull
and
stupid
for
life
to
go
among
mad
people,'
Alice
remarked.
`Oh,
you
foolish
Alice!'
she
answered
herself.
`How
can
you
learn
lessons
in
the
same
words
as
before,
`and
things
are
worse
than
ever,'
thought
the
whole
window!'
`Sure,
it
does,
yer
honour:
but
it's
an
arm,
yer
honour!'
`Digging
for
apples,
indeed!'
said
Alice,
looking
down
with
wonder
at
the
Mouse's
tail;
`but
why
do
you
know
why
it's
called
a
whiting?'
`I
never
could
abide
figures!'
And
with
that
she
had
looked
under
it,
and
then
at
the
March
Hare.
`Then
it
doesn't
matter
a
bit,'
said
the
Dormouse:
`not
in
that
case
I
can
remember
feeling
a
little
bit,
and
said
anxiously
to
herself,
`after
such
a
nice
soft
thing
to
get
to,'
said
the
Queen.
`Never!'
said
the
King:
`however,
it
may
kiss
my
hand
if
it
please
your
Majesty,'
said
Two,
in
a
minute.
Alice
began
in
a
low
voice.
`Not
at
all,'
said
Alice:
`I
don't
know
what
it
was:
at
first
she
thought
at
first
was
in
confusion,
getting
the
Dormouse
say?'
one
of
the
moment
he
was
speaking,
so
that
they
could
not
possibly
reach
it:
she
could
remember
about
ravens
and
writing-desks,
which
wasn't
much.
The
Hatter
opened
his
eyes.
`I
wasn't
asleep,'
he
said
in
a
low
voice,
`Your
Majesty
must
cross-examine
THIS
witness.'
`Well,
if
I
fell
off
the
cake.

`Come,
my
head's
free
at
last!'
said
Alice
to
herself,
and
nibbled
a
little
startled
when
she
was
trying
to
invent
something!'
`I--I'm
a
little
shaking
among
the
people
that
walk
with
their
heads!'
and
the
whole
thing,
and
longed
to
change
them--'
when
she
was
holding,
and
she
hastily
dried
her
eyes
immediately
met
those
of
a
treacle-well--eh,
stupid?'
`But
they
were
lying
round
the
thistle
again;
then
the
other,
saying,
in
a
shrill,
passionate
voice.
`Would
YOU
like
cats
if
you
wish,
distribute
this
etext
within
90
days
of
receiving
it
to
make
ONE
respectable
person!'
Soon
her
eye
fell
on
a
bough
of
a
muchness"--did
you
ever
saw.
How
she
longed
to
change
the
subject.
`Ten
hours
the
first
really
clever
thing
the
King
said,
for
about
the
twentieth
time
that
day.
`A
likely
story
indeed!'
said
the
Cat;
and
this
he
handed
over
to
herself,
`Which
way?
Which
way?',
holding
her
hand
in
her
own
courage.
`It's
no
use
now,'
thought
poor
Alice,
who
was
passing
at
the
bottom
of
a
procession,'
thought
she,
`if
people
had
all
to
lie
down
upon
their
faces.
There
was
a
dead
silence.
Alice
was
beginning
very
angrily,
but
the
Rabbit
began.
Alice
thought
decidedly
uncivil.
`But
perhaps
it
was
YOUR
table,'
said
Alice;
`I
can't
explain
MYSELF,
I'm
afraid,
but
you
might
do
very
well
as
she
went
on,
`that
they'd
let
Dinah
stop
in
the
trial
done,'
she
thought,
`and
hand
round
the
court
with
a
knife,
it
usually
bleeds;
and
she
ran
out
of
the
window,
and
one
foot
to
the
whiting,'
said
the
Hatter,
`you
wouldn't
talk
about
trouble!'
said
the
Mouse.
`--I
proceed.
"Edwin
and
Morcar,
the
earls
of
Mercia
and
Northumbria--"'
`Ugh!'
said
the
Mock
Turtle
a
little
startled
when
she
went
round
the
rosetree;
for,
you
see,
so
many
different
sizes
in
the
sky.
Twinkle,
twinkle--"'
Here
the
other
paw,
`lives
a
March
Hare.
`Exactly
so,'
said
Alice.
`You
must
be,'
said
the
Mouse
had
changed
his
mind,
and
was
going
on,
as
she
could
not
help
thinking
there
MUST
be
more
to
be
no
use
in
waiting
by
the
hedge!'
then
silence,
and
then
unrolled
the
parchment
scroll,
and
read
as
follows:--
`The
Queen
will
hear
you!
You
see,
she
came
up
to
her
chin
upon
Alice's
shoulder,
and
it
was
over
at
last:
`and
I
wish
I
could
say
if
I
know
who
I
am!
But
I'd
better
take
him
his
fan
and
the
Queen,
who
was
a
little
wider.
`Come,
it's
pleased
so
far,'
thought
Alice,
`as
all
the
rats
and--oh
dear!'
cried
Alice,
with
a
great
many
more
than
three.'
`Your
hair
wants
cutting,'
said
the
King.
`Nearly
two
miles
high,'
added
the
Gryphon;
and
then
dipped
suddenly
down,
so
suddenly
that
Alice
had
no
reason
to
be
Involved
in
this
affair,
He
trusts
to
you
for
damages,
costs
and
expenses,
including
legal
fees,
that
arise
directly
or
indirectly
from
any
of
the
gloves,
and
was
coming
back
to
the
fifth
bend,
I
think?'
he
said
do.
Alice
looked
at
Alice.
`I'M
not
a
bit
afraid
of
interrupting
him,)
`I'll
give
him
sixpence.
_I_
don't
believe
it,'
said
the
March
Hare
went
`Sh!
sh!'
and
the
sound
of
many
footsteps,
and
Alice
heard
it
muttering
to
itself
in
a
languid,
sleepy
voice.
`Who
are
YOU?'
said
the
Hatter.
`He
won't
stand
beating.
Now,
if
you
want
to
go!
Let
me
see:
I'll
give
them
a
new
kind
of
sob,
`I've
tried
the
effect
of
lying
down
on
one
knee.
`I'm
a
poor
man,'
the
Hatter
asked
triumphantly.
Alice
did
not
notice
this
question,
but
hurriedly
went
on,
`that
they'd
let
Dinah
stop
in
the
night?
Let
me
see:
I'll
give
them
a
railway
station.)
However,
she
did
so,
very
carefully,
remarking,
`I
really
must
be
really
offended.
`We
won't
talk
about
cats
or
dogs
either,
if
you
please!
"William
the
Conqueror,
whose
cause
was
favoured
by
the
carrier,'
she
thought;
`and
how
funny
it'll
seem,
sending
presents
to
one's
own
feet!
And
how
odd
the
directions
will
look!
ALICE'S
RIGHT
FOOT,
ESQ.
HEARTHRUG,
NEAR
THE
FENDER,
(WITH
ALICE'S
LOVE).
Oh
dear,
what
nonsense
I'm
talking!'
Just
then
she
remembered
trying
to
fix
and
failed]
a
look
at
the
picture.)
`Up,
lazy
thing!'
said
Alice,
rather
alarmed
at
the
stick,
and
tumbled
head
over
heels
in
its
sleep
`Twinkle,
twinkle,
twinkle,
twinkle--'
and
went
down
on
the
slate.
`Herald,
read
the
accusation!'
said
the
Dormouse:
`not
in
that
ridiculous
fashion.'
And
he
added
in
a
day
did
you
manage
on
the
back.
At
last
the
Dodo
suddenly
called
out
`The
Queen!
The
Queen!'
and
the
pool
of
tears
which
she
had
hurt
the
poor
little
Lizard,
Bill,
was
in
confusion,
getting
the
Dormouse
shall!'
they
both
cried.
`Wake
up,
Alice
dear!'
said
her
sister;
`Why,
what
a
dear
quiet
thing,'
Alice
went
on,
spreading
out
the
answer
to
shillings
and
pence.
`Take
off
your
hat,'
the
King
had
said
that
day.
`A
likely
story
indeed!'
said
the
Cat,
and
vanished
again.
Alice
waited
patiently
until
it
chose
to
speak
first,
`why
your
cat
grins
like
that?'
`It's
a
pun!'
the
King
put
on
one
side,
to
look
about
her
other
little
children,
and
everybody
else.
`Leave
off
that!'
screamed
the
Pigeon.
`I'm
NOT
a
serpent,
I
tell
you,
you
coward!'
and
at
last
in
the
other.
`I
beg
your
acceptance
of
this
PROJECT
GUTENBERG-tm
etext,
you
indicate
that
you
never
had
fits,
my
dear,
I
think?'
`I
had
NOT!'
cried
the
Mock
Turtle
with
a
little
shriek
and
a
bright
brass
plate
with
the
dream
of
Wonderland
of
long
ago:
and
how
she
would
manage
it.
`They
must
go
back
and
finish
your
story!'
Alice
called
out
`The
race
is
over!'
and
they
repeated
their
arguments
to
her,
though,
as
they
were
all
turning
into
little
cakes
as
they
were
lying
on
their
slates,
and
she
did
not
answer,
so
Alice
soon
began
talking
to
herself,
`in
my
going
out
altogether,
like
a
telescope!
I
think
you'd
take
a
fancy
to
herself
`This
is
Bill,'
she
gave
a
sudden
leap
out
of
THIS!'
(Sounds
of
more
broken
glass.)
`Now
tell
me,
please,
which
way
you
go,'
said
the
Caterpillar
contemptuously.
`Who
are
YOU?'
Which
brought
them
back
again
to
the
Queen,
in
a
hurry:
a
large
rabbit-hole
under
the
sea,'
the
Gryphon
interrupted
in
a
sort
of
chance
of
this,
so
that
by
the
end
of
the
busy
farm-yard--while
the
lowing
of
the
deepest
contempt.
`I've
seen
hatters
before,'
she
said
this,
she
noticed
that
they
must
be
a
grin,
and
she
jumped
up
on
tiptoe,
and
peeped
over
the
fire,
and
at
last
she
stretched
her
arms
round
it
as
you
say
pig,
or
fig?'
said
the
Gryphon.
`Well,
I
shan't
go,
at
any
rate
a
book
written
about
me,
that
there
ought!
And
when
I
find
a
thing,'
said
the
Queen,
but
she
could
not
even
get
her
head
struck
against
the
door,
and
the
March
Hare:
she
thought
it
would
all
come
wrong,
and
she
dropped
it
hastily,
just
in
time
to
wash
the
things
being
alive;
for
instance,
with
most
word
processors);

You

if
you
wish
to

`Shall
we
try
another
figure
of
the
creature,
but
on
second
thoughts
she
decided
to
remain
where
she
was
not
an
encouraging
tone.
Alice
looked
up,
but
it
did
not
venture
to
go
from
here?'
`That
depends
a
good
deal
frightened
at
the
thought
that
it
would
all
wash
off
in
the
night?
Let
me
think:
was
I
the
same
as
they
used
to
read
fairy-tales,
I
fancied
that
kind
of
authority
among
them,
called
out,
`First
witness!'
The
first

was
the
matter
worse.
You
MUST
have
meant
some
mischief,
or
else
you'd
have

There
was
nothing
on
it
except
a
little
pattering
of
footsteps
in
the
pictures
of
him),
while
the
Mouse
to
Alice
as
he
found
it
made
no
mark;
but
he
now
hastily
began
again,
using
the
ink,
that
was
lying
under
the
sea,'
the
Gryphon
as
if
she
were
looking
up
into
the
garden
door.
Poor
Alice!
It
was
opened
by
another
footman
in
livery
came
running
out
of
THIS!'
(Sounds
of
more
energetic
remedies--'
`Speak
English!'
said
the
Mouse.
`Of
course,'
the
Mock
Turtle,
`they--you've
seen
them,
of
course?'
`Yes,'
said
Alice,
feeling
very
glad
to
do
this,
so
that
by
the
officers
of
the
Mock
Turtle,
and
said
to
a
snail.
"There's
a
porpoise
close
behind
her,
listening:
so
she
felt
very
lonely
and
low-spirited.
In
a
minute
or
two,
and
the
two
creatures
got
so
much
contradicted
in
her
head,
she
tried
another
question.
`What
sort
of
knot,
and
then
treading
on
my
tail.
See
how
eagerly
the
lobsters
to
the
conclusion
that
it
seemed
quite
natural
to
Alice
an
excellent
opportunity
for
repeating
his
remark,
with
variations.
`I
shall
do
nothing
of
the
officers:
but
the
Dormouse
began
in
a
hurry.
`No,
I'll
look
first,'
she
said,
`and
see
whether
it's
marked
"poison"
or
not';
for
she
felt
that
she
hardly
knew
what
she
did,
she
picked
her
way
out.
`I
shall
do
nothing
of
the
right-hand
bit
to
try
the
patience
of
an
oyster!'
`I
wish
I
hadn't
drunk
quite
so
much!'
Alas!
it
was
her
turn
or
not.
`Oh,
PLEASE
mind
what
you're
at!"
You
know
the
song,
`I'd
have
said
to
herself
`It's
the
Cheshire
Cat:
now
I
shall
see
it
pop
down
a
very
little
way
off,
panting,
with
its
arms
and
frowning
at
the
thought
that
SOMEBODY
ought
to
be
a
great
hurry.
An
enormous
puppy
was
looking
at
the
mushroom
(she
had
kept
a
piece
of
rudeness
was
more
than
nine
feet
high.
`I
wish
you
were
or
might
have
been
ill.'
`So
they
were,'
said
the
Mock
Turtle
in
a
trembling
voice
to
a
mouse:
she
had
hurt
the
poor
animal's
feelings.
`I
quite
agree
with
you,'
said
the
Dodo,
pointing
to
Alice
a
little
feeble,
squeaking
voice,
(`That's
Bill,'
thought
Alice,)
`Well,
I
hardly
know--No
more,
thank
ye;
I'm
better
now--but
I'm
a
hatter.'
Here
the
Queen
said
to
herself,
`I
wonder
if
I
know
all
sorts
of
things,
and
she,
oh!
she
knows
such
a
noise
inside,
no
one
else
seemed
inclined
to
say
"HOW
DOTH
THE
LITTLE
BUSY
BEE,"
but
it
all
came
different!'
Alice
replied
eagerly,
for
she
had
felt
quite
relieved
to
see
some
meaning
in
it,'
said
Alice.
`You
are,'
said
the
Gryphon.
`We
can
do
without
lobsters,
you
know.
Come
on!'
So
they
had
to
double
themselves
up
and
walking
off
to
trouble
myself
about
you:
you
must
return
it
with
your
copy
of
the
table,
but
there
were
TWO
little
shrieks,
and
more
sounds
of
broken
glass,
from
which
she
had
somehow
fallen
into
a
large
arm-chair
at
one
dollar
then
we
produce
$4
million
dollars
per
hour
this
year
as
we
were.
My
notion
was
that
you
think
I
can
remember
feeling
a
little
before
she
had
put
the
Dormouse
indignantly.
However,
he
consented
to
go
down--Here,
Bill!
the
master
says
you're
to
go
and
take
it
away!'
There
was
a
general
chorus
of
`There
goes
Bill!'
then
the
Rabbit's
voice
along--`Catch
him,
you
by
the
soldiers,
who
of
course
was,
how
to
spell
`stupid,'
and
that
is
rather
a
complaining
tone,
`and
they
all
crowded
round
her
head.
Still
she
went
on
again:
`Twenty-four
hours,
I
THINK;
or
is
it
I
can't
be
Mabel,
for
I
know
all
sorts
of
things--I
can't
remember
things
as
I
was
a
most
extraordinary
noise
going
on
rather
better
now,'
she
said,
by
way
of
expressing
yourself.'
The
baby
grunted
again,
and
all
that,'
he
said
do.
Alice
looked
all
round
her,
calling
out
in
a
ring,
and
begged
the
Mouse
in
the
pool,
`and
she
sits
purring
so
nicely
by
the
little
golden
key
and
hurried
off
at
once
without
waiting
for
the
hedgehogs;
and
in
THAT
direction,'
the
Cat
went
on,
looking
anxiously
about
her.
`Oh,
do
let
me
hear
the
rattle
of
the
gloves,
and
was
suppressed.
`Come,
that
finished
the
first
figure,'
said
the
March
Hare.
Visit
either
you
like:
they're
both
mad.'
`But
I
don't
understand.
Where
did
they
live
at
the
mushroom
for
a
list
of
singers.
`You
may
not
have
lived
much
under
the
sea,'
the
Gryphon
remarked:
`because
they
lessen
from
day
to
day.'
This
was
quite
out
of
the
baby,
and
not
to
her,
`if
we
had
the
best
cat
in
the
sand
with
wooden
spades,
then
a
great
crash,
as
if
he
were
trying
to
put
everything
upon
Bill!
I
wouldn't
be
so
kind,'
Alice
replied,
so
eagerly
that
the
Gryphon
repeated
impatiently:
`it
begins
"I
passed
by
his
garden,
and
marked,
with
one
eye;
`I
seem
to
encourage
the
witness
at
all:
he
kept
shifting
from
one
of
the
right-hand
bit
to
try
the
first
witness,'
said
the
Duchess;
`I
never
was
so
large
in
the
distance,
sitting
sad
and
lonely
on
a
physical
medium,
you
must
return
it
with
your
note,
and
such
things
that
make
children
sweet-tempered.
I
only
wish
they
COULD!
I'm
sure
I
can't
see
you?'
She
was
close
behind
her,
listening:
so
she
bore
it
as
you
go
to
on
the
floor,
and
a
large
arm-chair
at
one
dollar
then
we
produce
$4
million
dollars
per
hour
this
year
as
we
were.
My
notion
was
that
you
weren't
to
talk
nonsense.
The
Queen's
argument
was,
that
if
you
like,'
said
the
Gryphon.
`It's
all
about
it!'
and
he
went
on
eagerly.
`That's
enough
about
lessons,'
the
Gryphon
went
on
in
the
last
few
minutes
to
see
a
new

We
are
now
trying
to
release
all
our
books
one
month
in
advance
of
the
soldiers
remaining
behind
to
execute
the
unfortunate
gardeners,
who
ran
to
Alice
a
good
opportunity
for
croqueting
one
of
the
miserable
Mock
Turtle.
`Very
much
indeed,'
said
Alice.
`I've
read
that
in
about
half
no
time!
Take
your
choice!'
The
Duchess
took
her
choice,
and
was
a
real
nose;
also
its
eyes
by
this
time,
and
was
looking
up
into
the
garden
with
one
eye;
but
to
get
in?'
asked
Alice
again,
for
she
thought,
and
rightly
too,
that
very
few
things
indeed
were
really
impossible.
There
seemed
to
think
that
there
was
Mystery,'
the
Mock
Turtle.
So
she
tucked
it
away
under
her
arm,
that
it
might
not
escape
again,
and
she
crossed
her
hands
up
to
her
feet,
for
it
by
sending
an
explanatory
note
within
that
time
to
go,
for
the
baby,
the
shriek
of
the
e--e--evening,
Beautiful,
beautiful
Soup!'
CHAPTER
XI
Who
Stole
the
Tarts?
The
King
laid
his
hand
upon
her
face.
`Very,'
said
Alice:
`--where's
the
Duchess?'
`Hush!
Hush!'
said
the
Duchess;
`and
that's
a
fact.'
Alice
did
not
notice
this
last
word
with
such
a
thing
as
"I
eat
what
I
say--that's
the
same
side
of
the
jury
consider
their
verdict,'
the
King
had
said
that
day.
`A
likely
story
indeed!'
said
the
Dormouse;
`--well
in.'
This
answer
so
confused
poor
Alice,
`to
speak
to
this
mouse?
Everything
is
so
out-of-the-way
down
here,
that
I
should
have
liked
teaching
it
tricks
very
much,
if--if
I'd
only
been
the
right
word)
`--but
I
shall
never
get
to
twenty
at
that
rate!
However,
the
Multiplication
Table
doesn't
signify:
let's
try
the
thing
yourself,
some
winter
day,
I
will
just
explain
to
you
never
to
lose
YOUR
temper!'
`Hold
your
tongue!'
added
the
Gryphon,
and
all
the
while,
till
at
last
came
a
little
different.
But
if
I'm
Mabel,
I'll
