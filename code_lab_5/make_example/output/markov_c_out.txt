Why
is
this
"Small
Print!"
and
all
of
them
even
when
they
saw
the
Mock
Turtle
with
a
bound
into
the
wood.
`It's
the
thing
Mock
Turtle
Soup
is
made
from,'
said
the
King,
going
up
to
them
she
heard
something
like
this:--
`Fury
said
to
herself,
rather
sharply;
`I
advise
you
to
get
very
tired
of
this.
I
vote
the
young
Crab,
a
little
of
the
e--e--evening,
Beautiful,
beautiful
Soup!'
CHAPTER
XI
Who
Stole
the
Tarts?
The
King
looked
anxiously
at
the
Mouse's
tail;
`but
why
do
you
know
you
say
"What
a
pity!"?'
the
Rabbit
came
near
her,
about
the
right
size,
that
it
had
fallen
into
a
tree.
`Did
you
say
it.'
`That's
nothing
to
do."
Said
the
mouse
doesn't
get
out."
Only
I
don't
believe
there's
an
atom
of
meaning
in
it,'
said
Alice
aloud,
addressing
nobody
in
particular.
`She'd
soon
fetch
it
here,
lad!--Here,
put
'em
up
at
the
door--I
do
wish
they
COULD!
I'm
sure
_I_
shan't
be
beheaded!'
`What
for?'
said
Alice.
`Why,
there
they
lay
sprawling
about,
reminding
her
very
much
confused,
`I
don't
see
how
he
can
EVEN
finish,
if
he
thought
it
over
afterwards,
it
occurred
to
her
ear.
`You're
thinking
about
something,
my
dear,
and
that
he
had
a
large
fan
in
the
face.
`I'll
put
a
white
one
in
by
mistake;
and
if
it
wasn't
trouble
enough
hatching
the
eggs,'
said
the
Knave,
`I
didn't
write
it,
and
they
repeated
their
arguments
to
her,
`if
we
had
the
door
of
which
was
sitting
next
to
no
toys
to
play
croquet.'
The
Frog-Footman
repeated,
in
the
air:
it
puzzled
her
too
much,
so
she
tried
hard
to
whistle
to
it;
but
she
saw
them,
they
were
mine
before.
If
I
or
she
should
meet
the
real
Mary
Ann,
what
ARE
you
doing
out
here?
Run
home
this
moment,
I
tell
you!'
But
she
went
on:
`--that
begins
with
an
M--'
`Why
with
an
M?'
said
Alice.
`Why?'
`IT
DOES
THE
BOOTS
AND
SHOES.'
the
Gryphon
repeated
impatiently:
`it
begins
"I
passed
by
his
face
only,
she
would
feel
with
all
speed
back
to
my
right
size
to
do
it.'
(And,
as
you
say
it.'
`That's
nothing
to
what
I
get"
is
the
driest
thing
I
ever
heard!'
`Yes,
I
think
I
can
kick
a
little!'
She
drew
her
foot
slipped,
and
in
another
minute
there
was
a
little
bit,
and
said
`What
else
have
you
executed,
whether
you're
a
little
while,
however,
she
again
heard
a
little
snappishly.
`You're
enough
to
try
the
whole
head
appeared,
and
then
a
voice
sometimes
choked
with
sobs,
to
sing
you
a
replacement
copy.
If
you
received
it
from.
If
you
have
just
been
reading
about;
and
when
she
heard
something
splashing
about
in
the
sea.
The
master
was
an
immense
length
of
neck,
which
seemed
to
listen,
the
whole
party
at
once
to
eat
or
drink
anything;
so
I'll
just
see
what
would
be
four
thousand
miles
down,
I
think--'
(she
was
so
ordered
about
in
all
directions,
tumbling
up
against
each
other;
however,
they
got
their
tails
in
their
proper
places--
ALL,'
he
repeated
with
great
curiosity.
`It's
a
friend
of
mine--a
Cheshire
Cat,'
said
Alice:
`three
inches
is
such
a
fall
as
this,
I
shall
only
look
up
in
great
fear
lest
she
should
meet
the
real
Mary
Ann,
and
be
turned
out
of
its
mouth
again,
and
Alice
rather
unwillingly
took
the
opportunity
of
adding,
`You're
looking
for
eggs,
I
know
all
the
jurors
had
a
little
of
the
work,
although
tilde
(~),
asterisk
(*)
and
underline
(_)
characters
may
be
on
may
contain
"Defects".
Among
other
things,
this
means
that
no
one
could
possibly
hear
you.'
And
certainly
there
was
a
large
crowd
collected
round
it:
there
were
any
tears.
No,
there
were
no
tears.
`If
you're
going
to
say,'
said
the
Mouse,
getting
up
and
said,
very
gravely,
`I
think,
you
ought
to
be
patted
on
the
glass
table
and
the
moon,
and
memory,
and
muchness--
you
know
that
Cheshire
cats
always
grinned;
in
fact,
I
didn't
know
that
Cheshire
cats
always
grinned;
in
fact,
I
didn't
know
that
cats
COULD
grin.'
`They
all
can,'
said
the
Mouse.
`Of
course,'
the
Dodo
could
not
join
the
dance?"'
`Thank
you,
sir,
for
your
walk!"
"Coming
in
a
more
subdued
tone,
and
everybody
laughed,
`Let
the
jury
asked.
`That
I
can't
see
you?'
She
was
a
different
person
then.'
`Explain
all
that,'
he
said
to
herself,
and
shouted
out,
`You'd
better
not
do
that
again!'
which
produced
another
dead
silence.
`It's
a
Cheshire
cat,'
said
the
young
Crab,
a
little
glass
box
that
was
sitting
on
a
crimson
velvet
cushion;
and,
last
of
all
the
creatures
argue.
It's
enough
to
drive
one
crazy!'
The
Footman
seemed
to
listen,
the
whole
place
around
her
became
alive
the
strange
creatures
of
her
favourite
word
`moral,'
and
the
Queen
to-day?'
`I
should
like
to
be
treated
with
respect.
`Cheshire
Puss,'
she
began,
in
a
fight
with
another
hedgehog,
which
seemed
to
be
a
very
little!
Besides,
SHE'S
she,
and
I'm
sure
I
have
done
just
as
well.
The
twelve
jurors
were
writing
down
`stupid
things!'
on
their
faces,
so
that
her
neck
would
bend
about
easily
in
any
direction,
like
a
Jack-in-the-box,
and
up
the
little
golden
key,
and
Alice's
first
thought
was
that
you
have
of
putting
things!'
`It's
a
friend
of
mine--a
Cheshire
Cat,'
said
Alice:
`three
inches
is
such
a
rule
at
processions;
`and
besides,
what
would
be
quite
absurd
for
her
to
wink
with
one
eye;
but
to
open
it;
but,
as
the
other.'
As
soon
as
she
could,
for
her
to
wink
with
one
eye,
How
the
Owl
and
the
Hatter
said,
tossing
his
head
mournfully.
`Not
I!'
said
the
Hatter,
`I
cut
some
more
of
the
party
sat
silent
and
looked
at
Two.
Two
began
in
a
very
truthful
child;
`but
little
girls
eat
eggs
quite
as
safe
to
stay
in
here
any
longer!'
She
waited
for
some
while
in
silence.
Alice
was
not
even
room
for
her.
`Yes!'
shouted
Alice.
`Come
on,
then,'
said
Alice,
always
ready
to
talk
to.'
`How

thinking
of?'
`I

Why
is
this
New
Zealand
or
Australia?'
(and
she
tried
to
speak,
but
for
a
little
faster?"
said
a
sleepy
voice
behind
her.
`Collar
that
Dormouse,'
the
Queen
added
to
one
of
the
busy
farm-yard--while
the
lowing
of
the
Nile
On
every
golden
scale!
`How
cheerfully
he
seems
to
like
her,
down
here,
that
I
should
say
"With
what
porpoise?"'
`Don't
you
mean
by
that?'
said
the
Pigeon.
`I
can
see
you're
trying
to
put
his
mouth
close
to
her,
And
mentioned
me
to
sell
you
a
couple?'
`You
are
old,'
said
the
Hatter,
`I
cut
some
more
tea,'
the
March
Hare.
Alice
was
silent.
The
Dormouse
shook
itself,
and
began
to
repeat
it,
but
her
head
struck
against
the
roof
was
thatched
with
fur.
It
was
so
much
about
a
thousand
times
as
large
as
himself,
and
this
Alice
would
not
stoop?
Soup
of
the
court.
`What
do
you
like
the
Mock
Turtle,
suddenly
dropping
his
voice;
and
Alice
was
not
here
before,'
said
the
King,
and
the
other
end
of
the
trees
behind
him.
`--or
next
day,
maybe,'
the
Footman
went
on
again:--
`I
didn't
know
how
to
get
hold
of
it;
then
Alice
dodged
behind
a
great
deal
to
come
down
the
bottle,
saying
to
herself
`It's
the
oldest
rule
in
the
grass,
merely
remarking
as
it
happens;
and
if
the
Queen
ordering
off
her
unfortunate
guests
to
execution--once
more
the
pig-baby
was
sneezing
on
the
whole
window!'
`Sure,
it
does,
yer
honour:
but
it's
an
arm
for
all
that.'
`With
extras?'
asked
the
Mock
Turtle
angrily:
`really
you
are
painting
those
roses?'
Five
and
Seven
said
nothing,
but
looked
at
it,
busily
painting
them
red.
Alice
thought
she
might
find
another
key
on
it,
for
she
was
always
ready
to
sink
into
the
earth.
At
last
the
Mouse,
turning
to
Alice.
`Only
a
thimble,'
said
Alice
in
a
tone
of
the
house
if
it
thought
that
SOMEBODY
ought
to
go
near
the
King
had
said
that
day.
`A
likely
story
indeed!'
said
Alice,
`it's
very
interesting.
I
never
understood
what
it
was:
she
was
beginning
to
feel
which
way
it
was
impossible
to
say
a
word,
but
slowly
followed
her
back
to
her:
its
face
in
her
life,
and
had
come
back
with
the
bread-and-butter
getting
so
used
to
call
him
Tortoise--'
`Why
did
they
live
on?'
said
Alice,
timidly;
`some
of
the
well,
and
noticed
that
they
couldn't
get
them
out
with
trying,
the
poor
child,
`for
I
never
was
so
long
since
she
had
never
before
seen
a
good
character,
But
said
I
didn't!'
interrupted
Alice.
`You
are,'
said
the
Duchess;
`and
the
moral
of
that
is--"Oh,
'tis
love,
that
makes
them
so
shiny?'
Alice
looked
down
into
its
eyes
again,
to
see
if
there
are,
nobody
attends
to
them--and
you've
no
idea
what
a
Mock
Turtle
with
a
T!'
said
the
King.
On
this
the
whole
she
thought
to
herself,
and
fanned
herself
with
one
of
them
at
last,
and
managed
to
put
everything
upon
Bill!
I
wouldn't
be
so
kind,'
Alice
replied,
rather
shyly,
`I--I
hardly
know,
sir,
just
at
first,
but,
after
watching
it
a
violent
blow
underneath
her
chin:
it
had
fallen
into
a
line
along
the
sea-shore--'
`Two
lines!'
cried
the
Mock
Turtle,
`Drive
on,
old
fellow!
Don't
be
all
day
about
it!'
Last
came
a
little
girl
or
a
watch
to
take
the
hint;
but
the
great
puzzle!'
And
she
began
shrinking
directly.
As
soon
as
she
could.
`The
Dormouse
is
asleep
again,'
said
the
Mock
Turtle
yawned
and
shut
his
note-book
hastily.
`Consider
your
verdict,'
the
King
put
on
her
lap
as
if
it
began
ordering
people
about
like
that!'
But
she
went
on,
turning
to
the
little
creature
down,
and
the
moment
she
felt
that
there
was
a
table,
with
a
cart-horse,
and
expecting
every
moment
to
be
a
letter,
after
all:
it's
a
French
mouse,
come
over
with
fright.
`Oh,
I
BEG
your
pardon!'

Alice

WONDERLAND
Lewis
Carroll
THE
MILLENNIUM
FULCRUM
EDITION
3.0
CHAPTER
I
Down
the
Rabbit-Hole
Alice
was
thoroughly
puzzled.
`Does
the
boots
and
shoes!'
she
repeated
in
a
dreamy
sort
of
lullaby
to
it
in
a
wondering
tone.
`Why,
what
are
YOUR
shoes
done
with?'
said
the
Caterpillar.
`Well,
perhaps
not,'
said
Alice
aloud,
addressing
nobody
in
particular.
`She'd
soon
fetch
it
here,
lad!--Here,
put
'em
up
at
the
mushroom
(she
had
grown
up,'
she
said
to
herself;
`the
March
Hare
took
the
hookah
out
of
sight,
he
said
in
a
rather
offended
tone,
and
she
jumped
up
in
great
fear
lest
she
should
push
the
matter
worse.
You
MUST
have
meant
some
mischief,
or
else
you'd
have
signed
your
name
like
an
honest
man.'
There
was
a
body
to
cut
it
off
from:
that
he
had
come
to
the
croquet-ground.
The
other
side
of
the
other
paw,
`lives
a
Hatter:
and
in
his
note-book,
cackled
out
`Silence!'
and
read
as
follows:--
`The
Queen
of
Hearts
were
seated
on
their
hands
and
feet,
to
make
out
exactly
what
they
WILL
do
next!
As
for
pulling
me
out
of
the
Rabbit's
voice
along--`Catch
him,
you
by
the
prisoner
to--to
somebody.'
`It
must
have
imitated
somebody
else's
hand,'
said
the
Hatter:
`as
the
things
I
used
to
say.'
`So
he
did,
so
he
did,'
said
the
Caterpillar
contemptuously.
`Who
are
YOU?'
said
the
Caterpillar.
`Well,
I
hardly
know--No
more,
thank
ye;
I'm
better
now--but
I'm
a
deal
faster
than
it
does.'
`Which
would
NOT
be
an
old
crab,
HE
was.'
`I
never
could
abide
figures!'
And
with
that
she
had
forgotten
the
little
golden
key
was
too
much
of
a
well--'
`What
did
they
live
on?'
said
Alice,
who
was
gently
brushing
away
some
dead
leaves
that
lay
far
below
her.
`What
CAN
all
that
stuff,'
the
Mock
Turtle
sighed
deeply,
and
drew
the
back
of
one
flapper
across
his
eyes.
He
looked
anxiously
round,
to
make
out
which
were
the
two
creatures
got
so
close
to
her
great
disappointment
it
was
very
nearly
carried
it
off.

CHAPTER
II
The
Pool
of
Tears
`Curiouser
and
curiouser!'
cried
Alice
hastily,
afraid
that
it
was
done.
They
had
not
gone
far
before
they
saw
the
Mock
Turtle
sighed
deeply,
and
drew
the
back
of
one
flapper
across
his
eyes.
He
looked
anxiously
at
the
corners:
next
the
ten
courtiers;
these
were
all
shaped
like
the
look
of
the
lefthand
bit
of
the
house
of
the
ground--and
I
should
think
you
might
sue
us
if
there
were
ten
of
them,
with
her
head!'
Alice
glanced
rather
anxiously
at
the
sides
of
it;
and
the
m--'
But
here,
to
Alice's
great
surprise,
the
Duchess's
knee,
while
plates
and
dishes
crashed
around
it--once
more
the
pig-baby
was
sneezing
and
howling
alternately
without
a
moment's
delay
would
cost
them
their
lives.
All
the
time
when
I
learn
music.'
`Ah!
that
accounts
for
it,'
said
Alice,
a
good
way
off,
and
she
grew
no
larger:
still
it
had
no
reason
to
be
nothing
but
the
wise
little
Alice
was
beginning
to
feel
very
queer
indeed:--
`'Tis
the
voice
of
the
other
players,
and
shouting
`Off
with
his
nose,
you
know?'
`It's
the
Cheshire
Cat,
she
was
trying
to
fix
on
one,
the
cook
till
his
eyes
were
nearly
out
of
breath,
and
till
the
eyes
appeared,
and
then
turned
to
the
conclusion
that
it
ought
to
have
changed
since
her
swim
in
the
pictures
of
him),
while
the
Mouse
replied
rather
impatiently:
`any
shrimp
could
have
been
ill.'
`So
they
were,'
said
the
King,
and
the
fall
NEVER
come
to
the
shore,
and
then
turned
to
the
Hatter.
Alice
felt
dreadfully
puzzled.
The
Hatter's
remark
seemed
to
be
a
LITTLE
larger,
sir,
if
you
were
never
even
introduced
to
a
mouse:
she
had
found
the
fan
and
the
others
looked
round
also,
and
all
that,'
said
the
Duck:
`it's
generally
a
ridge
or
furrow
in
the
air.
This
time
there
were
ten
of
them,
with
her
head!'
Those
whom
she
sentenced
were
taken
into
custody
by
the
end
of
the
earth.
Let
me
see:
that
would
happen:
`"Miss
Alice!
Come
here
directly,
and
get
in
at
all?'
said
Alice,
quite
forgetting
her
promise.
`Treacle,'
said
the
King,
going
up
to
her
head,
and
she
jumped
up
on
to
himself
as
he
spoke,
`we
were
trying--'
`I
see!'
said
the
Hatter,
`when
the
Queen
was
in
such
confusion
that
she
was
near
enough
to
drive
one
crazy!'
The
Footman
seemed
to
quiver
all
over
their
slates;
`but
it
doesn't
matter
much,'
thought
Alice,
`it'll
never
do
to
ask:
perhaps
I
shall
think
nothing
of
tumbling
down
stairs!
How
brave
they'll
all
think
me
at
home!
Why,
I
haven't
been
invited
yet.'
`You'll
see
me
there,'
said
the
King.
`I
can't
remember
half
of
fright
and
half
believed
herself
in
Wonderland,
though
she
felt
that
this
could
not
swim.
He
sent
them
word
I
had
our
Dinah
here,
I
know
THAT
well
enough;
don't
be
nervous,
or
I'll
kick
you
down
stairs!'
`That
is
not
said
right,'
said
the
Hatter.
`He
won't
stand
beating.
Now,
if
you
drink
much
from
a
Caterpillar
The
Caterpillar
and
Alice
looked
all
round
her
at
the
top
of
his
tail.
`As
if
I
might
venture
to
ask
any
more
questions
about
it,
you
know.'
`I
DON'T
know,'
said
the
King,
with
an
important
air,
`are
you
all
ready?
This
is
ten
thousand
titles
each
to
one
of
them
bowed
low.
`Would
you
tell
me,'
said
Alice,
rather
alarmed
at
the
number
of
cucumber-frames
there
must
be!'
thought
Alice.
The
King
laid
his
hand
upon
her
knee,
and
looking
at
Alice
for
protection.
`You
shan't
be
able!
I
shall
fall
right
THROUGH
the
earth!
How
funny
it'll
seem
to
see
what
would
happen
next.
First,
she
tried
to
get
into
her
face,
with
such
a
pleasant
temper,
and
thought
to
herself.
`Shy,
they
seem
to
be"--or
if
you'd
like
it
very
much,'
said
Alice;
`I
might
as
well
as
she
spoke.
(The
unfortunate
little
Bill
had
left
off
when
they
passed
too
close,
and
waving
their
forepaws
to
mark
the
time,
while
the
Mock
Turtle
replied
in
an
offended
tone.
And
the
Eaglet
bent
down
its
head
to
hide
a
smile:
some
of
the
way
down
one
side
and
up
the
conversation
dropped,
and
the
second
verse
of
the
wood--(she
considered
him
to
be
two
people!
Why,
there's
hardly
enough
of
it
had
gone.
`Well!
I've
often
seen
a
rabbit
with
either
a
waistcoat-pocket,
or
a
watch
to
take
MORE
than
nothing.'
`Nobody
asked
YOUR
opinion,'
said
Alice.
`Well,
I
shan't
go,
at
any
rate,
there's
no
use
denying
it.
I
suppose
you'll
be
telling
me
next
that
you
couldn't
cut
off
a
head
unless
there
was
hardly
room
for
YOU,
and
no
more
to
do
it?'
`In
my
youth,'
said
the
Caterpillar,
and
the
constant
heavy
sobbing
of
the
garden:
the
roses
growing
on
it
but
tea.
`I
don't
even
know
what
a
dear
little
puppy
it
was!'
said
Alice,
a
good
many
little
girls
eat
eggs
quite
as
safe
to
stay
with
it
as
you
might
sue
us
if
there
are,
nobody
attends
to
them--and
you've
no
idea
what
you're
talking
about,'
said
Alice.
`Why?'
`IT
DOES
THE
BOOTS
AND
SHOES.'
the
Gryphon
replied
very
gravely.
`What
else
have
you
executed,
whether
you're
a
little
pattering
of
feet
in
a
natural
way.
`I
thought
it
must
be
what
he
did
it,)
he
did
not
at
all
know
whether
it
was
growing,
and
she
said
to
Alice.
`Nothing,'
said
Alice.
`You
must
be,'
said
the
King.
On
this
the
White
Rabbit
interrupted:
`UNimportant,
your
Majesty
means,
of
course,'
said
the
Queen.
`It
proves
nothing
of
tumbling
down
stairs!
How
brave
they'll
all
think
me
at
home!
Why,
I
do
hope
it'll
make
me
grow
large
again,
for
really
I'm
quite
tired
and
out
of
his
Normans--"
How
are
you
getting
on?'
said
the
Caterpillar
angrily,
rearing
itself
upright
as
it
didn't
much
matter
which
way
she
put
one
arm
out
of
the
court.
All
this
time
she
found
she
could
not
stand,
and
she
had
hurt
the
poor
little
feet,
I
wonder
if
I
fell
off
the
top
of
it.
Presently
the
Rabbit
just
under
the
Project's
"PROJECT
GUTENBERG"
trademark.
To

the

and
holding
it
to
the
general
conclusion,
that
wherever
you
go
on?
It's
by
far
the
most
confusing
thing
I
know.
Silence
all
round,
if
you
were
or
might
have
been
changed
in
the
world
am
I?
Ah,
THAT'S
the
great
hall,
with
the
Gryphon.
`The
reason
is,'
said
the
Mock
Turtle
in
the
house
if
it
began
ordering
people
about
like
mad
things
all
this
time.
`I
want
a
clean
cup,'
interrupted
the
Hatter:
`I'm
on
the
breeze
that
followed
them,
the
melancholy
words:--
`Soo--oop
of
the
sort,'
said
the
Dormouse;
`--well
in.'
This
answer
so
confused
poor
Alice,
who
was
trembling
down
to
them,
they
were
lying
round
the
court
with
a
lobster
as
a
goal
to
accomplish
by
the
pope,
was
soon
submitted
to
by
all
three
to
settle
the
question,
and
they
sat
down
and
looked
very
uncomfortable.
The
moment
Alice
appeared,
she
was
out
of
the
ground--and
I
should
think
you'll
feel
it
a
very
curious
thing,
and
she
soon
made
out
that
she
was
a
table
set
out
under
a
tree
in
the
distance,
screaming
with
passion.
She
had
quite
a
crowd
of
little
birds
and
beasts,
as
well
say,'
added
the
March
Hare
went
`Sh!
sh!'
and
the
Gryphon
interrupted
in
a
melancholy
air,
and,
after
waiting
till
she
shook
the
house,
quite
forgetting
in
the
newspapers,
at
the
sudden
change,
but
she
remembered
the
number
of
changes
she
had
sat
down
and
saying
to
herself
that
perhaps
it
was
the
same
thing
as
"I
get
what
I
could
not
join
the
dance.
`"What
matters
it
how
far
we
go?"
his
scaly
friend
replied.
"There
is
another
shore,
you
know,
this
sort
of
chance
of
her
sharp
little
chin
into
Alice's
head.
`Is
that
all?'
said
Alice,
`I've
often
seen
them
so
shiny?'
Alice
looked
all
round
her,
about
four
feet
high.
`I
wish
I
could
say
if
I
fell
off
the
cake.
*
*
*
`What
a
funny
watch!'
she
remarked.
`There
isn't
any,'
said
the
Caterpillar.
This
was
such
a
puzzled
expression
that
she
was
now
only
ten
inches
high,
and
her
eyes
to
see
how
the
Dodo
could
not
tell
whether
they
were
gardeners,
or
soldiers,
or
courtiers,
or
three
times
over
to
herself,
rather
sharply;
`I
advise
you
to
keep
this
file
on
your
own
disk,
keeping
an
electronic
path
open
for
the
pool
rippling
to
the
rose-tree,
she
went
on,
without
attending
to
her;
`but
those
serpents!
There's
no
pleasing
them!'
Alice
was
not
even
room
for
her.
`I
wish
I
could
not
possibly
reach
it:
she
could
not
join
the
dance?"'
`Thank
you,
sir,
for
your
interesting
story,'
but
she
ran
off
as
hard
as
she
ran;
but
the
Gryphon
hastily.
`Go
on
with
the
Gryphon.
`It
all
came
different!'
Alice
replied
in
an
offended
tone,
`Hm!
No
accounting
for
tastes!
Sing
her
"Turtle
Soup,"
will
you,
won't
you,
will
you
join
the
dance?
Will
you,
won't
you,
will
you
join
the
dance?
Will
you,
won't
you,
won't
you
join
the
dance.
Would
not,
could
not,
could
not,
would
not,
could
not,
would
not,
could
not
even
room
for
YOU,
and
no
one
to
listen
to
me!
I'LL
soon
make
you
grow
taller,
and
the
Queen's
ears--'
the
Rabbit
asked.
`No,
I
give
you
a
couple?'
`You
are
not
the
smallest
notice
of
her
skirt,
upsetting
all
the
unjust
things--'
when
his
eye
chanced
to
fall
upon
Alice,
as
she
could
do
to
hold
it.
As
soon
as
there
seemed
to
listen,
the
whole
party
at
once
took
up
the
little
golden
key
and
hurried
off
to
other
parts
of
the
Lobster;
I
heard
him
declare,
"You
have
baked
me
too
brown,
I
must
be
getting
somewhere
near
the
door
of
the
conversation.
Alice
felt
dreadfully
puzzled.
The
Hatter's
remark
seemed
to
listen,
the
whole
party
look
so
grave
and
anxious.)
Alice
could
hardly
hear
the
words:--
`I
speak
severely
to
my
right
size
to
do
such
a
subject!
Our
family
always
HATED
cats:
nasty,
low,
vulgar
things!
Don't
let
him
know
she
liked
them
best,
For
this
must
be
Mabel
after
all,
and
I
never
knew
so
much
contradicted
in
her
life
before,
and
behind
it
was
sneezing
and
howling
alternately
without
a
cat!
It's
the
most
interesting,
and
perhaps
as
this
before,
never!
And
I
declare
it's
too
bad,
that
it
might
end,
you
know,'
said
the
King
in
a
court
of
justice
before,
but
she
could
get
to
the
jury,
and
the
roof
off.'
After
a
time
she
had
looked
under
it,
and
found
in
it
a
minute
or
two,
and
the
others
all
joined
in
chorus,
`Yes,
please
do!'
pleaded
Alice.
`And
be
quick
about
it,'
added
the
Gryphon,
and
the
moment
how
large
she
had
put
on
one
side,
to
look
at
the
Gryphon
went
on
talking:
`Dear,
dear!
How
queer
everything
is
to-day!
And
yesterday
things
went
on
muttering
over
the
fire,
stirring
a
large
dish
of
tarts
upon
it:
they
looked
so
good,
that
it
might
end,
you
know,'
Alice
gently
remarked;
`they'd
have
been
a
RED
rose-tree,
and
we
won't
talk
about
cats
or
dogs
either,
if
you
got
in
your
knocking,'
the
Footman
remarked,
`till
tomorrow--'
At
this
the
White
Rabbit:
it
was
impossible
to
say
a
word,
but
slowly
followed
her
back
to
my
right
size
to
do
it!
Oh
dear!
I
shall
never
get
to
twenty
at
that
rate!
However,
the
Multiplication
Table
doesn't
signify:
let's
try
the
thing
at
all.
However,
`jury-men'
would
have
called
him
a
fish)--and
rapped
loudly
at
the
Hatter,
and,
just
as
well
as
she
could,
for
the
next
witness.'
And
he
got
up
and
repeat
something
now.
Tell
her
to
carry
it
further.
So
she
began
nibbling
at
the
time
he
was
in
confusion,
getting
the
Dormouse
sulkily
remarked,
`If
you
can't
be
Mabel,
for
I
know
who
I
am!
But
I'd
better
take
him
his
fan
and
two
or
three
pairs
of
tiny
white
kid
gloves
in
one
hand
and
a
large
cat
which
was
sitting
on
the
trumpet,
and
called
out,
`First
witness!'
The
first
witness
was
the
first
to
speak.
`What
size
do
you
call
him
Tortoise--'
`Why
did
they
live
at
the
jury-box,
and
saw
that,
in
her
haste,
she
had
got
burnt,
and
eaten
up
by
a
row
of
lodging
houses,
and
behind
it,
it
occurred
to
her
head,
and
she
looked
down
into
a
tidy
little
room
with
a
trumpet
in
one
hand
and
a
large
one,
but
it
is.'
`Then
you
should
say
what
you
like,'
said
the
Queen,
the
royal
children;
there
were
no
arches
left,
and
all
sorts
of
things,
and
she,
oh!
she
knows
such
a
dear
little
puppy
it
was!'
said
Alice,
`because
I'm
not
Ada,'
she
said,
as
politely
as
she
went
on
at
last,
more
calmly,
though
still
sobbing
a
little
before
she
came
upon
a
heap
of
sticks
and
dry
leaves,
and
the
White
Rabbit
with
pink
eyes
ran
close
by
it,
and
finding
it
very
much,'
said
the
Hatter.
`Stolen!'
the
King
said
to
the
jury.
`Not
yet,
not
yet!'
the
Rabbit
in
a
piteous
tone.
And
the
Gryphon
replied
very
politely,
`if
I
had
it
written
down:
but
I
shall
fall
right
THROUGH
the
earth!
How
funny
it'll
seem,
sending
presents
to
one's
own
feet!
And
how
odd
the
directions
will
look!
ALICE'S
RIGHT
FOOT,
ESQ.
HEARTHRUG,
NEAR
THE
FENDER,
(WITH
ALICE'S
LOVE).
Oh
dear,
what
nonsense
I'm
talking!'
Just
then
her
head
in
the
act
of
crawling
away:
besides
all
this,
there
was
silence
for
some
way,
and
the
procession
came
opposite
to
Alice,
very
much
to-night,
I
should
have
liked
teaching
it
tricks
very
much,
if--if
I'd
only
been
the
right
word)
`--but
I
shall
have
to
whisper
a
hint
to
Time,
and
round
Alice,
every
now
and
then;
such
as,
that
a
moment's
pause.
The
only
things
in
the
world!
Oh,
my
dear
paws!
Oh
my
fur
and
whiskers!
She'll
get
me
executed,
as
sure
as
ferrets
are
ferrets!
Where
CAN
I
have
to
ask
his
neighbour
to
tell
him.
`A
nice
muddle
their
slates'll
be
in
a
natural
way
again.
`I
wonder
if
I
must,
I
must,'
the
King
said
to
herself,
`after
such
a
new
idea
to
Alice,
and
she
grew
no
larger:
still
it
was
too
late
to
wish
that!
She
went
in
without
knocking,
and
hurried
upstairs,
in
great
fear
lest
she
should
meet
the
real
Mary
Ann,
what
ARE
you
talking
to?'
said
the
March
Hare
went
`Sh!
sh!'
and
the
words
a
little,
and
then
raised
himself
upon
tiptoe,
put
his
mouth
close
to
her
in
the
chimney
close
above
her:
then,
saying
to
herself
that
perhaps
it
was
talking
in
a
sorrowful
tone,
`I'm
afraid
I
am,
sir,'
said
Alice;
not
that
she
wanted
much
to
know,
but
the
Dormouse
say?'
one
of
the
sort.
Next
came
the
guests,
mostly
Kings
and
Queens,
and
among
them
Alice
recognised
the
White
Rabbit,
`but
it
seems
to
suit
them!'
`I
haven't
opened
it
yet,'
said
the
Lory
positively
refused
to
tell
you--all
I
know
all
the
rats
and--oh
dear!'
cried
Alice
again,
for
really
I'm
quite
tired
of
being
such
a
tiny
golden
key,
and
Alice's
first
thought
was
that
you
couldn't
cut
off
a
little
faster?"
said
a
whiting
to
a
lobster--'
(Alice
began
to
say
it
any
longer
than
that,'
said
the
King:
`however,
it
may
kiss
my
hand
if
it
likes.'
`I'd
rather
not,'
the
Cat
in
a
furious
passion,
and
went
on
to
her
feet,
for
it
to
the
Duchess:
`flamingoes
and
mustard
both
bite.
And
the
Gryphon
interrupted
in
a
more
subdued
tone,
and
she
tried
her
best
to
climb
up
one
of
the
jury
asked.
`That
I
can't
get
out
again.
That's
all.'
`Thank
you,'
said
the
Knave,
`I
didn't
mean
it!'
pleaded
poor
Alice.
`But
you're
so
easily
offended,
you
know!'
The
Mouse
looked
at
the
Hatter,
`or
you'll
be
telling
me
next
that
you
couldn't
cut
off
a
head
unless
there
was
no
`One,
two,
three,
and
away,'
but
they
were
nowhere
to
be
Number
One,'
said
Alice.
`I'm
glad
they
don't
give
birthday
presents
like
that!'
By
this
time
she
went
on.
`Or
would
you
like
the
Queen?'
said
the
Mock
Turtle
said
with
some
severity;
`it's
very
interesting.
I
never
heard
it
say
to
this:
so
she
went
back
for
a
rabbit!
I
suppose
you'll
be
telling
me
next
that
you
couldn't
cut
off
a
bit
of
stick,
and
made
another
rush
at
Alice
for
protection.
`You
shan't
be
beheaded!'
`What
for?'
said
Alice.
`I've
tried
every
way,
and
the
little
door,
so
she
took
courage,
and
went
in.
The
door
led
right
into
a
butterfly,
I
should
have
liked
teaching
it
tricks
very
much,
if--if
I'd
only
been
the
right
house,
because
the
chimneys
were
shaped
like
the
name:
however,
it
only
grinned
when
it
saw
Alice.
It
looked
good-
natured,
she
thought:
still
it
was
looking
at
the
mushroom
(she
had
grown
up,'
she
said
to
herself,
in
a
ring,
and
begged
the
Mouse
replied
rather
crossly:
`of
course
you
know
what
they're
about!'
`Read
them,'
said
the
King,
going
up
to
the
door,
and
the
three
gardeners
instantly
threw
themselves
flat
upon
their
faces.
There
was
no
more
of
the
water,
and
seemed
not
to
be
no
use
in
saying
anything
more
till
the
eyes
appeared,
and
then
all
the
first
minute
or
two
she
walked
on
in
a
trembling
voice,
`--and
I
hadn't
gone
down
that
rabbit-hole--and
yet--and
yet--it's
rather
curious,
you
know,
this
sort
in
her
pocket,
and
pulled
out
a
box
of
comfits,
(luckily
the
salt
water
had
not
attended
to
this
last
remark,
`it's
a
vegetable.
It
doesn't
look
like
it?'
he
said,
turning
to
the
Mock
Turtle
would
be
four
thousand
miles
down,
I
think--'
(she
was
so
much
already,
that
it
would
be
like,
`--for
they
haven't
got
much
evidence
YET,'
she
said
to
the
other
two
were
using
it
as
she
could.
`The
game's
going
on
within--a
constant
howling
and
sneezing,
and
every
now
and
then;
such
as,
that
a
moment's
pause.
The
only
things
in
the
lap
of
her
ever
getting
out
of
the
trees
as
well
as
she
passed;
it
was
written
to
nobody,
which
isn't
usual,
you
know.'
`I
DON'T
know,'
said
Alice
in
Wonderland***

WHAT
IF
YOU
GIVE
NOTICE
OF
THE
SLUGGARD,"'
said
the
cook.
`Treacle,'
said
the
King;
and
the
White
Rabbit
returning,
splendidly
dressed,
with
a
table
in
the
distance,
and
she
very
seldom
followed
it),
and
sometimes
she
scolded
herself
so
severely
as
to
go
down
the
chimney!'
`Oh!
So
Bill's
got
to
see
if
she
had
tired
herself
out
with
trying,
the
poor
little
thing
sat
down
again
very
sadly
and
quietly,
and
looked
at
it,
busily
painting
them
red.
Alice
thought
she
might
as
well
say,'
added
the
March
Hare
said
to
herself
`Now
I
can
reach
the
key;
and
if
it
please
your
Majesty?'
he
asked.
`Begin
at
the
bottom
of
a
sea
of
green
leaves
that
had
a
large
one,
but
it
is.'
`Then
you
should
say
"With
what
porpoise?"'
`Don't
you
mean
that
you
have
an
up
to
her
lips.
`I
know
SOMETHING
interesting
is
sure
to
make
the
arches.
The
chief
difficulty
Alice
found
at
first
was
moderate.
But
the
snail
replied
"Too
far,
too
far!"
and
gave
a
little
different.
But
if
I'm
Mabel,
I'll
stay
down
here
with
me!
There
are
no
mice
in
the
sea.
But
they
HAVE
their
tails
in
their
mouths.
So
they
got
settled
down
again
into
its
nest.
Alice
crouched
down
among
the
branches,
and
every
now
and
then,
if
I
can
remember
feeling
a
little
pattering
of
feet
on
the
other
side
of
the
evening,
beautiful
Soup!
Soup
of
the
house!'
(Which
was
very
hot,
she
kept
tossing
the
baby
was
howling
so
much
surprised,
that
for
the
garden!'
and
she
tried
to
look
for
her,
and
she
hurried
out
of
its
mouth
again,
and
put
back
into
the
book
her
sister
was
reading,
but
it
is.'
`I
quite
agree
with
you,'
said
the
Footman,
and
began
smoking
again.
This
time
there
were
a
Duck
and
a
sad
tale!'
said
the
King,
`that
only
makes
the
world
go
round!"'
`Somebody
said,'
Alice
whispered,
`that
it's
done
by
everybody
minding
their
own
business,'
the
Duchess
replied,
in
a
hurry.
`No,
I'll
look
first,'
she
said,
`than
waste
it
in
a
very
fine
day!'
said
a
timid
voice
at
her
rather
inquisitively,
and
seemed
to
Alice
with
one
finger
pressed
upon
its
forehead
(the
position
in
which
you
usually
see
Shakespeare,
in
the
pool
a
little
before
she
had
been
of
late
much
accustomed
to
usurpation
and
conquest.
Edwin
and
Morcar,
the
earls
of
Mercia
and
Northumbria--"'
`Ugh!'
said
the
Dormouse,
who
was
beginning
very
angrily,
but
the
Hatter
with
a
bound
into
the
sky.
Twinkle,
twinkle--"'
Here
the
Queen
was
close
behind
her,
listening:
so
she
went
on,
`What
HAVE
you
been
doing
here?'
`May
it
please
your
Majesty?'
he
asked.
`Begin
at
the
top
with
its
eyelids,
so
he
with
his
whiskers!'
For
some
minutes
it
puffed
away
without
speaking,
but
at
last
turned
sulky,
and
would
only
say,
`I
am
older
than
you,
and
don't
speak
a
word
till
I've
finished.'
So
they
got
thrown
out
to
her
feet
in
the
same
size:
to
be
seen:
she
found
that
her
shoulders
were
nowhere
to
be
executed
for
having
missed
their
turns,
and
she
felt
a
very
difficult
question.
However,
at
last
it
unfolded
its
arms,
took
the
watch
and
looked
at
each
other
for
some
time
without
interrupting
it.
`They
were
learning
to
draw,
you
know--'
She
had
just
begun
to
dream
that
she
had
not
gone
(We
know
it
was
all
ridges
and
furrows;
the
balls
were
live
hedgehogs,
the
mallets
live
flamingoes,
and
the
cool
fountains.
CHAPTER
VIII
The
Queen's
Croquet-Ground
A
large
rose-tree
stood
near
the
King
said
to
herself,
`whenever
I
eat
or
drink
something
or
other;
but
the
wise
little
Alice
herself,
and
began
picking
them
up
again
with
a
table
in
the
last
few
minutes,
and
began
to
say
a
word,
but
slowly
followed
her
back
to
them,
and
just
as
usual.
`Come,
there's
half
my
plan
done
now!
How
puzzling
all
these
changes
are!
I'm
never
sure
what
I'm
going
to
begin
lessons:
you'd
only
have
to
ask
help
of
any
one;
so,
when
the
White
Rabbit,
`but
it
sounds
uncommon
nonsense.'
Alice
said
very
politely,
`for
I
never
knew
so
much
frightened
to
say
whether
the
pleasure
of
making
a
daisy-chain
would
be
worth
the
trouble
of
getting
up
and
rubbed
its
eyes:
then
it
watched
the
Queen
jumped
up
in
her
brother's
Latin
Grammar,
`A
mouse--of
a
mouse--to
a
mouse--a
mouse--O
mouse!'
The
Mouse
did
not
like
the
look
of
it
at
last,
with
a
sudden
leap
out
of
breath,
and
said
`That's
very
curious!'
she
thought.
`I
must
be
getting
somewhere
near
the
door,
and
tried
to
look
through
into
the
air
off
all
its
feet
at
once,
she
found
herself
in
Wonderland,
though
she
knew
that
it
had
some
kind
of
rule,
`and
vinegar
that
makes
them
bitter--and--and
barley-sugar
and
such
things
that
make
children
sweet-tempered.
I
only
wish
it
was,'
he
said.
`Fifteenth,'
said
the
Queen,
turning
purple.
`I
won't!'
said
Alice.
`And
ever
since
that,'
the
Hatter
instead!'
CHAPTER
VII
A
Mad
Tea-Party
There
was
nothing
else
to
do,
and
perhaps
as
this
before,
never!
And
I
declare
it's
too
bad,
that
it
was
quite
tired
of
being
upset,
and
their
slates
and
pencils
had
been
all
the
way
wherever
she
wanted
much
to
know,
but
the
Dodo
in
an
offended
tone,
`so
I
can't
quite
follow
it
as
you
liked.'
`Is
that
all?'
said
the
Eaglet.
`I
don't
see
how
the
game
began.
Alice
thought
to
herself,
`it
would
be
the
use
of
repeating
all
that
green
stuff
be?'
said
Alice.
`Well,
then,'
the
Gryphon
whispered
in
reply,
`for
fear
they
should
forget
them
before
the
officer
could
get
to
twenty
at
that
rate!
However,
the
Multiplication
Table
doesn't
signify:
let's
try
the
effect:
the
next
month.
Since
our
ftp
program
has
a
bug
in
it
that
scrambles
the
date
[tried
to
fix
and
failed]
a
look
at
a
king,'
said
Alice.
`Why
not?'
said
the
Gryphon.
`--you
advance
twice--'
`Each
with
a
great
crowd
assembled
about
them--all
sorts
of
things--I
can't
remember
half
of
them--and
it
belongs
to
a
mouse:
she
had
caught
the
baby
was
howling
so
much
about
a
whiting
to
a
mouse,
you
know.
But
do
cats
eat
bats?'
and
sometimes,
`Do
bats
eat
cats?'
for,
you
see,
so
many
out-of-the-way
things
had
happened
lately,
that
Alice
said;
`there's
a
large
pool
all
round
her,
about
the
crumbs,'
said
the
Cat
remarked.
`Don't
be
impertinent,'
said
the
Hatter.
`I
deny
it!'
said
the
Lory
hastily.
`I
thought
you
did,'
said
the
Gryphon:
and
Alice
rather
unwillingly
took
the
regular
course.'
`What
was
that?'
inquired
Alice.
`Reeling
and
Writhing,
of
course,
Alice
could
bear:
she
got
up
this
morning,
but
I
shall
never
get
to
the
other,
and
making
faces
at
him
as
he
spoke.
`A
cat
may
look
at
the
stick,
and
tumbled
head
over
heels
in
its
sleep
`Twinkle,
twinkle,
twinkle,
twinkle--'
and
went
to
the
Dormouse,
without
considering
at
all
for
any
of
them.
However,
on
the
floor,
as
it
went,
`One
side
of
the
crowd
below,
and
there
stood
the
Queen
shouted
at
the
mushroom
(she
had
grown
in
the
air.
`--as
far
out
to
sea.
So
they
began
solemnly
dancing
round
and
swam
slowly
back
again,
and
the
three
gardeners
instantly
threw
themselves
flat
upon
their
faces,
so
that
altogether,
for
the
baby,
and
not
to
be
seen--everything
seemed
to
Alice
with
one
of
the
jurymen.
`It
isn't
mine,'
said
the
King;
and
as
Alice
could
only
see
her.
She
is
such
a
rule
at
processions;
`and
besides,
what
would
be
quite
as
much
as
serpents
do,
you
know.'
He
was
an
old
Turtle--we
used
to
read
fairy-tales,
I
fancied
that
kind
of
sob,
`I've
tried
every
way,
and
nothing
seems
to
like
her,
down
here,
that
I
should
say
"With
what
porpoise?"'
`Don't
you
mean
by
that?'
said
the
Gryphon
at
the
bottom
of
the
gloves,
and
was
gone
in
a
minute,
while
Alice
thought
this
a
very
respectful
tone,
but
frowning
and
making
quite
a
large
kitchen,
which
was
lit
up
by
wild
beasts
and
other
unpleasant
things,
all
because
they
WOULD
go
with
Edgar
Atheling
to
meet
William
and
offer
him
the
crown.
William's
conduct
at
first
was
moderate.
But
the
snail
replied
"Too
far,
too
far!"
and
gave
a
sudden
burst
of
tears,
but
said
nothing.
`This
here
young
lady,'
said
the
youth,
`as
I
mentioned
before,
And
have
grown
most
uncommonly
fat;
Yet
you
balanced
an
eel
on
the
door
opened
inwards,
and
Alice's
first
thought
was
that
she
was
not
a
regular
rule:
you
invented
it
just
missed
her.
Alice
caught
the
baby
with
some
severity;
`it's
very
easy
to
take
the
hint;
but
the
Hatter
was
the
only
difficulty
was,
that
you
do
either!'
And
the
Gryphon
went
on,
`--likely
to
win,
that
it's
hardly
worth
while
finishing
the
game.'
The
Queen
turned
crimson
with
fury,
and,
after
waiting
till
she
was
playing
against
herself,
for
she
was
considering
in
her
lessons
in
the
world
am
I?
Ah,
THAT'S
the
great
question
certainly
was,
what?
Alice
looked
at
Alice.
`I'M
not
a
moment
to
think
that
proved
it
at
all,'
said
Alice:
`--where's
the
Duchess?'
`Hush!
Hush!'
said
the
Cat,
`if
you
don't
derive
profits,
no
royalty
is
due.
Royalties
are
payable
to
"Project
Gutenberg
Association
/
Illinois
Benedictine
College
(the
"Project").
Among
other
things,
this
means
that
no
one
to
listen
to
her,
And
mentioned
me
to
sell
you
a
present
of
everything
I've
said
as
yet.'
`A
cheap
sort
of
idea
that
they
must
needs
come
wriggling
down
from
the
shock
of
being
such
a
curious
dream!'
said
Alice,
and
she
thought
it
had
finished
this
short
speech,
they
all
spoke
at
once,
she
found
she
had
been
anxiously
looking
across
the
field
after
it,
`Mouse
dear!
Do
come
back
and
finish
your
story!'
Alice
called
after
her.
`I've
something
important
to
say!'
This
sounded
promising,
certainly:
Alice
turned
and
came
back
again.
`Keep
your
temper,'
said
the
Duchess.
An
invitation
from
the
time
he
was
going
a
journey,
I
should
think!'
(Dinah
was
the
first
to
speak.
`What
size
do
you
know
what
to
say
to
itself
in
a
great
hurry
to
change
the
subject
of
conversation.
`Are
you--are
you
fond--of--of
dogs?'
The
Mouse
looked
at
each
other
for
some
time
busily
writing
in
his
turn;
and
both
the
hedgehogs
were
out
of
the
right-hand
bit
to
try
the
experiment?'
`HE
might
bite,'
Alice
cautiously
replied,
not
feeling
at
all
a
proper
way
of
speaking
to
a
mouse:
she
had
been
looking
over
their
slates;
`but
it
doesn't
mind.'
The
table
was
a
general
chorus
of
voices
asked.
`Why,
SHE,
of
course,'
he
said
do.
Alice
looked
down
into
a
tree.
`Did
you
say
it.'
`That's
nothing
to
do."
Said
the
mouse
doesn't
get
out."
Only
I
don't
know
of
any
that
do,'
Alice
said
with
a
large
cat
which
was
lit
up
by
two
guinea-pigs,
who
were
giving
it
a
little
more
conversation
with
her
head!'
Alice
glanced
rather
anxiously
at
the
beginning,'
the
King
said
to
live.
`I've
seen
a
rabbit
with
either
a
waistcoat-pocket,
or
a
watch
to
take
out
of
the
earth.
Let
me
see:
I'll
give
them
a
new
pair
of
white
kid
gloves
and
a
sad
tale!'
said
the
Rabbit
angrily.
`Here!
Come
and
help
me
out
of
it,
and
yet
it
was
only
the
pepper
that
had
fallen
into
a
conversation.
Alice
felt
a
little
timidly:
`but
it's
no
use
in
waiting
by
the
time
at
the
important
information
in
this
header.
We
encourage
you
to
learn?'
`Well,
there
was
nothing
on
it
in
with
the
Queen,
`and
he
shall
tell
you
what
year
it
is?'
`Of
course
twinkling
begins
with
an
M,
such
as
mouse-traps,
and
the
great
concert
given
by
the
hedge!'
then
silence,
and
then
said,
`It
WAS
a
narrow
escape!'
said
Alice,
`how
am
I
to
do?'
said
Alice.
`Come,
let's
hear
some
of
the
stated
month.
A
preliminary
version
may
often
be
posted
for
suggestion,
comment
and
editing
by
those
who
wish
to
offend
the
Dormouse
shall!'
they
both
sat
silent
and
looked
at
them
with
large
eyes
full
of
smoke
from
one
foot
up
the
conversation
a
little.
`'Tis
so,'
said
Alice.
`Exactly
so,'
said
Alice.
`Well,
I
can't
put
it
right;
`not
that
it
seemed
quite
natural);
but
when
the
White
Rabbit
hurried
by--the
frightened
Mouse
splashed
his
way
through
the
door,
and
knocked.
`There's
no
sort
of
way,
`Do
cats
eat
bats?'
and
sometimes,
`Do
bats
eat
cats?'
for,
you
see,
Alice
had
no
reason
to
be
no
doubt
that
it
might
not
escape
again,
and
we
won't
talk
about
her
pet:
`Dinah's
our
cat.
And
she's
such
a
neck
as
that!
No,
no!
You're
a
serpent;
and
there's
no
meaning
in
it.'
The
jury
all
brightened
up
again.)
`Please
your
Majesty,'
said
Two,
in
a
day
is
very
confusing.'
`It
isn't,'
said
the
Gryphon

`I
thought
it
must
be
really
offended.
`We
won't
talk
about
cats
or
dogs
either,
if
you
drink
much
from
a
Caterpillar
The
Caterpillar
was
the
White
Rabbit
with
pink
eyes
ran
close
by
it,
and
then
Alice
put
down
the
hall.
After
a
minute
or
two,
it
was
over
at
last:
`and
I
wish
you
would
seem
to
come
once
a
week:
HE
taught
us
Drawling,
Stretching,
and
Fainting
in
Coils.'
`What
was
THAT
like?'
said
Alice.
`Well,
I
never
understood
what
it
might
not
escape
again,
and
went
on
growing,
and
very
angrily.
`A
knot!'
said
Alice,
`I've
often
seen
a
rabbit
with
either
a
waistcoat-pocket,
or
a
serpent?'
`It
matters
a
good
deal:
this
fireplace
is
narrow,
to
be
treated
with
respect.
`Cheshire
Puss,'
she
began,
rather
timidly,
as
she
came
upon
a
neat
little
house,
and
the
baby
--the
fire-irons
came
first;
then
followed
a
shower
of
little
cartwheels,
and
the
little
golden
key
in
the
distance,
screaming
with
passion.
She
had
quite
forgotten
the
words.'
So
they
couldn't
get
them
out
again.
Suddenly
she
came
upon
a
little
while,
however,
she
went
on:
`--that
begins
with
a
soldier
on
each
side
to
guard
him;
and
near
the
right
size
for
going
through
the
door,
and
knocked.
`There's
no
such
thing!'
Alice
was
silent.
The
Dormouse
had
closed
its
eyes
were
nearly
out
of
a
muchness?'
`Really,
now
you
ask
me,'
said
Alice,
`we
learned
French
and
music.'
`And
washing?'
said
the
King,
looking
round
the
table,
but
it
just
now.'
`It's
the
stupidest
tea-party
I
ever
was
at
in
all
my
limbs
very
supple
By
the
time
he
had
a
little
pattering
of
feet
on
the
slate.
`Herald,
read
the
accusation!'
said
the
cook.
The
King
laid
his
hand
upon
her
knee,
and
the
fall
NEVER
come
to
the
Gryphon.
`It
all
came
different!'
the
Mock
Turtle.
`Seals,
turtles,
salmon,
and
so
on.'
`What
a
pity
it
wouldn't
stay!'
sighed
the
Hatter.
`Does
YOUR
watch
tell
you
my
adventures--beginning
from
this
morning,'
said
Alice
to
herself.
`Of
the
mushroom,'
said
the
King.
(The
jury
all
wrote
down
on
their
throne
when
they
liked,
so
that
her
idea
of
having
the
sentence
first!'
`Hold
your
tongue,
Ma!'
said
the
Gryphon.
Alice
did
not
venture
to
say
when
I
got
up
and
straightening
itself
out
again,
and
that's
all
you
know
about
this
business?'
the
King
said,
with
a
sigh.
`I
only
took
the
place
of
the
house!'
(Which
was
very
nearly
carried
it
off.
`If
everybody
minded
their
own
business,'
the
Duchess
asked,
with
another
dig
of
her
voice.
Nobody
moved.
`Who
cares
for
you?'
said
the
Pigeon
in
a
very
difficult
game
indeed.
The
players
all
played
at
once
crowded
round
her
head.
Still
she
went
on.
`Or
would
you
like
the
Mock
Turtle.
`Very
much
indeed,'
said
Alice.
`I've
read
that
in
about
half
no
time!
Take
your
choice!'
The
Duchess
took
her
choice,
and
was
just
going
to
give
the
prizes?'
quite
a
conversation
of
it
now
in
sight,
hurrying
down
it.
There
was
not
easy
to
know
when
the
Rabbit
asked.
`No,
I
didn't,'
said
Alice:
`--where's
the
Duchess?'
`Hush!
Hush!'
said
the
King:
`leave
out
that
part.'
`Well,
at
any
rate
it
would
be
so
easily
offended!'
`You'll
get
used
up.'
`But
what
am
I
to
do
with
this
creature
when
I
sleep"
is
the
driest
thing
I
know.
Silence
all
round,
if
you
were
never
even
spoke
to
Time!'
`Perhaps
not,'
Alice
replied
in
an
offended
tone,
`Hm!
No
accounting
for
tastes!
Sing
her
"Turtle
Soup,"
will
you,
won't
you
join
the
dance?
"You
can
really
have
no
sort
of
contribution
you
can
find
it.'
And
she
went
down
on
their
slates,
`SHE
doesn't
believe
there's
an
atom
of
meaning
in
it.'
The
jury
all
wrote
down
on
one
knee
as
he
spoke,
and
added
`It
isn't
mine,'
said
the
Dodo.
Then
they
all
looked
so
good,
that
it
seemed
quite
dull
and
stupid
for
life
to
go
from
here?'
`That
depends
a
good
many
voices
all
talking
at
once,
with
a
kind
of
sob,
`I've
tried
every
way,
and
the
three
gardeners
who
were
lying
on
the
English
coast
you
find
a
number
of
executions
the
Queen
left
off,
quite
out
of
the
sort,'
said
the
Hatter.
`You
might
just
as
I'd
taken
the
highest
tree
in
front
of
the
bread-and-butter.
Just
at
this
corner--No,
tie
'em
together
first--they
don't
reach
half
high
enough
yet--Oh!
they'll
do
next!
If
they
had
to
fall
upon
Alice,
as
she
couldn't
answer
either
question,
it
didn't
much
matter
which
way
it
was
the
Hatter.
`It
isn't
directed
at
all,'
said
the
young
Crab,
a
little
timidly,
`why
you
are
painting
those
roses?'
Five
and
Seven
said
nothing,

at

Alice,

to
get
through

more
and
more
faintly

carried
on
the
door
opened
inwards,

was

But
for
the
accident
of
the
house!'
(Which
was
very
uncomfortable,
and,
as
a
lark,
And
will
talk
in
contemptuous
tones
of
the
cakes,
and
was
going
to
turn
into
a
cucumber-frame,
or
something
of
the
sense,
and
the
little
golden
key
in
the
distance.
`Come
on!'
and
ran
till
she
was
now
only
ten
inches
high,
and
was
going
to
remark
myself.'
`Have
you
guessed
the
riddle
yet?'
the
Hatter
replied.
`Of
course
twinkling
begins
with
an
M,
such
as
mouse-traps,
and
the
words
have
got
in
your
knocking,'
the
Footman
remarked,
`till
tomorrow--'
At
this
moment
Alice
appeared,
she
was
not
an
encouraging
opening
for
a
minute,
trying
to
invent
something!'
`I--I'm
a
little
animal
(she
couldn't
guess
of
what
work
it
would
like
the
three
gardeners,
oblong
and
flat,
with
their
heads!'
and
the
jury
asked.
`That
I
can't
tell
you
more
than
three.'
`Your
hair
wants
cutting,'
said
the
Duchess:
you'd
better
leave
off,'
said
the
Caterpillar,
just
as
well
go
in
at
once.'
And
in
she
went.
Once
more
she
found
that
her
shoulders
were
nowhere
to
be
executed
for
having
cheated
herself
in
a
mournful
tone,
`he
won't
do
a
thing
before,
but
she
remembered
having
seen
such
a
thing
before,
but
she
did
not
like
to
drop
the
jar
for
fear
of
their
hearing
her;
and
the
shrill
voice
of
the
treat.
When
the
sands
are
all
dry,
he
is
gay
as
a
lark,
And
will
talk
in
contemptuous
tones
of
her
head
made
her
draw
back
in
their
mouths--and
they're
all
over
with
William
the
Conqueror.'
(For,
with
all
her
life.
Indeed,
she
had
caught
the
baby
was
howling
so
much
frightened
that
she
had
to
stoop
to
save
her
neck
from
being
run
over;
and
the
great
puzzle!'
And
she
went
nearer
to
make
out
what
it
meant
till
now.'
`If
that's
all
I
can
say.'
This
was
not
a
mile
high,'
said
Alice.
`Did
you
say
pig,
or
fig?'
said
the
King,
the
Queen,
`and
he
shall
tell
you
my
adventures--beginning
from
this
morning,'
said
Alice
in
a
very
humble
tone,
going
down
on
one
of
the
jurors
had
a
consultation
about
this,
and
she
went
round
the
court
and
got
behind
Alice
as
it
was
in
the
night?
Let
me
see--how
IS
it
to
her
ear.
`You're
thinking
about
something,
my
dear,
YOU
must
cross-examine
the
next
witness
was
the
White
Rabbit;
`in
fact,
there's
nothing
written
on
the
whole
party
at
once
took
up
the
fan
and
gloves,
and,
as
a
PROJECT
GUTENBERG-tm
etext,
you
indicate
that
you
had
been
to
her,
so
she
waited.
The
Gryphon
lifted
up
both
its
paws
in
surprise.
`What!
Never
heard
of
one,'
said
Alice,
who
had
been
looking
at
it
uneasily,
shaking
it
every
now
and
then;
such
as,
that
a
red-hot
poker
will
burn
you
if
you
don't
derive
profits,
no
royalty
is
due.
Royalties
are
payable
to
"Project
Gutenberg/IBC",
and
are
tax
deductible
to
the
puppy;
whereupon
the
puppy
began
a
series
of
short
charges
at
the
Caterpillar's
making
such
a
thing
I
ever
heard!'
`Yes,
I
think
you'd
better
leave
off,'
said
the
Rabbit
whispered
in
a
whisper,
half
afraid
that
it
ought
to
have
wondered
at
this,
that
she
began
very
cautiously:
`But
I
don't
want
YOU
with
us!"'
`They
were
learning
to
draw,'
the
Dormouse
said--'
the
Hatter
hurriedly
left
the
court,
arm-in-arm
with
the
Dutchess,
it
had
struck
her
foot!
She
was
a
table
in
the
first
figure!'
said
the
Cat.
`I
said
pig,'
replied
Alice;
`and
I
do
wonder
what
they
said.
The
executioner's
argument
was,
that
you
understand,
agree
to
also
provide
on
request
at
no
additional
cost,
fee
or
expense,
a
copy
of
the
sense,
and
the
Queen's
voice
in
the
window?'
`Sure,
it's
an
arm,
yer
honour!'
(He
pronounced
it
`arrum.')
`An
arm,
you
goose!
Who
ever
saw
one
that
size?
Why,
it
fills
the
whole
she
thought
of
herself,
`I
don't
think
they
play
at
all
a
pity.
I
said
"What
for?"'
`She
boxed
the
Queen's
shrill
cries
to
the
cur,
"Such
a
trial,
dear
Sir,
With
no
jury
or
judge,
would
be
four
thousand
miles
down,
I
think--'
(for,
you
see,
Miss,
this
here
ought
to
have
changed
since
her
swim
in
the
world
she
was
now
only
ten
inches
high,
and
her
face
like
the
Mock
Turtle
said
with
a
yelp
of
delight,
and
rushed
at
the
Hatter,
it
woke
up
again
with
a
sigh:
`he
taught
Laughing
and
Grief,
they
used
to
call
him
Tortoise,
if
he
thought
it
must
be
collected
at
once
to
eat
her
up
in
a
natural
way
again.
`I
wonder
if
I've
kept
her
waiting!'
Alice
felt
dreadfully
puzzled.
The
Hatter's
remark
seemed
to
think
that
very
few
little
girls
of
her
ever
getting
out
of
the
month
is
it?'
The
Gryphon
sat
up
and
down,
and
the
Queen
said
to
the
jury.
They
were
indeed
a
queer-looking
party
that
assembled
on
the
back.
However,
it
was
all
ridges
and
furrows;
the
balls
were
live
hedgehogs,
the
mallets
live
flamingoes,
and
the
other
end
of
the
earth.
Let
me
think:
was
I
the
same
thing,
you
know.'
`Who
is
this?'
She
said
the
Mock
Turtle,
who
looked
at
her
side.
She
was
a
bright
idea
came
into
Alice's
head.
`Is
that
all?'
said
Alice,
quite
forgetting
that
she
tipped
over
the
edge
of
her
going,
though
she
knew
the
meaning
of
half
those
long
words,
and,
what's
more,
I
don't
think,'
Alice
went
on
saying
to
herself,
rather
sharply;
`I
advise
you
to
leave
off
being
arches
to
do
with
this
creature
when
I
get
SOMEWHERE,'
Alice
added
as
an
explanation.
`Oh,
you're
sure
to
happen,'
she
said
to
the
Classics
master,
though.
He
was
looking
for
eggs,
I
know
I
do!'
said
Alice
in
a
whisper,
half
afraid
that
it
was
written
to
nobody,
which
isn't
usual,
you
know.'
`I
DON'T
know,'
said
the
Queen,
and
in
another
moment,
splash!
she
was
out
of
his
tail.
`As
if
it
thought
that
it
seemed
quite
natural
to
Alice
severely.
`What
are
they
made
of?'
`Pepper,
mostly,'
said
the
Hatter:
`but
you
could
see
it
trying
in
a
long,
low
hall,
which
was
immediately
suppressed
by
the
reader
at
no
additional
cost,
fee
or
expense,
a
copy
of
this
pool?
I
am
now?
That'll
be
a
footman
in
livery
came
running
out
of
the
hall;
but,
alas!
either
the
locks
were
too
large,
or
the
key
was
lying
on
the
song,
perhaps?'
`I've
heard
something
splashing
about
in
the
other:
the
only
difficulty
was,
that
you
weren't
to
talk
nonsense.
The
Queen's
Croquet-Ground
A
large
rose-tree
stood
near
the
entrance
of
the
court,
`Bring
me
the
truth:
did
you
ever
see
such
a
pleasant
temper,
and
thought
it
would
feel
with
all
her
coaxing.
Hardly
knowing
what
she
was
terribly
frightened
all
the
rest,
Between
yourself
and
me.'
`That's
the
reason
they're
called
lessons,'
the
Gryphon
repeated
impatiently:
`it
begins
"I
passed
by
his
garden."'
Alice
did
not
appear,
and
after
a
few
yards
off.
The
Cat
only
grinned
a
little
girl,'
said
Alice,
as
she
leant
against
a
buttercup
to
rest
her
chin
in
salt
water.
Her
first
idea
was
that
she
had
put
the
Lizard
as
she
could,
`If
you
please,
sir--'
The
Rabbit
started
violently,
dropped
the
white
kid
gloves
while
she
remembered
how
small
she
was
about
a
foot
high:
then
she
walked
off,
leaving
Alice
alone
with
the
bones
and
the
choking
of
the
court
with
a
kind
of
thing
that
would
happen:
`"Miss
Alice!
Come
here
directly,
and
get
in
at
all?'
said
the
Gryphon:
and
it
put
more
simply--"Never
imagine
yourself
not
to
her,
though,
as
they
came
nearer,
Alice
could
speak
again.
In
a
little
quicker.
`What
a
number
of
changes
she
had
someone
to
listen
to
me!
When
I
used
to
do:--
`How
doth
the
little--"'
and
she
swam
nearer
to
make
SOME
