The Csv java application imports a csv file and parses it, storing each comma delimitted entry and printing it out to the console.
The application takes the input file path as the first command line arguement.
The run time of the Csv parser is taken and printed out to the console. The number of lines is also printed out to the console.

For testing run test_script, this will run the makefile and the application with a sample input csv file
ie: ./test_script

Using MakeFile:
make - compiles code with dependencies
make run - runs the application with test data

Alternatively
To compile: javac Csv.java
To run: java Csv [filename]
