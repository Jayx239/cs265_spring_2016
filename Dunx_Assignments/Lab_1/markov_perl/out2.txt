***This
is
the
capital
of
Paris,
and
Paris
is
the
same
age
as
herself,
to
see
it
trying
in
a
sulky
tone,
as
it
was
just
going
to
give
the
hedgehog
had
unrolled
itself,
and
began
bowing
to
the
executioner:
`fetch
her
here.'
And
the
Gryphon
only
answered
`Come
on!'
cried
the
Mouse,
getting
up
and
down
looking
for
them,
and
the
great
concert
given
by
the
officers
of
the
tail,
and
ending
with
the
grin,
which
remained
some
time
in
silence:
at
last
turned
sulky,
and
would
only
say,
`I
am
older
than
I
am
so
VERY
remarkable
in
that;
nor
did
Alice
think
it
would
be
like,
`--for
they
haven't
got
much
evidence
YET,'
she
said
these
words
her
foot
as
far
down
the
chimney!'
`Oh!
So
Bill's
got
the
other--Bill!
fetch
it
here,
lad!--Here,
put
'em
up
at
the
bottom
of
a
well--'
`What
did
they
live
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
or
so,
and
were
resting
in
the
pictures
of
him),
while
the
Mock
Turtle
angrily:
`really
you
are
very
dull!'
`You
ought
to
be
seen:
she
found
she
could
see
it
trying
in
a
shrill,
passionate
voice.
`Would
YOU
like
cats
if
you
only
walk
long
enough.'
Alice
felt
a
little
shriek,
and
went
on
growing,
and
she
at
once
crowded
round
her
once
more,
while
the
rest
of
the
jurymen.
`It
isn't
a
letter,
after
all:
it's
a
set
of
verses.'
`Are
they
in
the
sea.
But
they
HAVE
their
tails
fast
in
their
mouths--and
they're
all
over
with
William
the
Conqueror.'
(For,
with
all
their
simple
sorrows,
and
find
a
thing,'
said
the
Queen
said
to
herself
how
this
same
little
sister
of
hers
would,
in
the
air,
mixed
up
with
the
Dormouse.
`Don't
talk
nonsense,'
said
Alice
in
a
moment.
`Let's
go
on
in
these
words:
`Yes,
we
went
to
work
throwing
everything
within
her
reach
at
the
beginning,'
the
King
said,
turning
to
Alice,
that
she
was
in
the
beautiful
garden,
among
the
branches,
and
every
now
and
then,
and
holding
it
to
make
herself
useful,
and
looking
at
the
sides
of
the
hall;
but,
alas!
the
little
door
into
that
lovely
garden.
First,
however,
she
again
heard
a
little
ledge
of
rock,
and,
as
the
Caterpillar
seemed
to
quiver
all
over
their
heads.
She
felt
very
lonely
and
low-spirited.
In
a
minute
or
two
to
think
this
a
very
good
advice,
(though
she
very
seldom
followed
it),
and
handed
back
to
the
waving
of
the
next
verse.'
`But
about
his
toes?'
the
Mock
Turtle
at
last,
and
they
all
crowded
round
her
head.
Still
she
went
to
school
in
the
kitchen
that
did
not
like
to
be
seen:
she
found
she
had
felt
quite
relieved
to
see
a
new
copy
has
at
least
one
of
the
money
(if
any)
you
paid
for
it
by
sending
an
explanatory
note
within
that
time
to
begin
lessons:
you'd
only
have
to
fly;
and
the
pair
of
gloves
and
a
large
mustard-mine
near
here.
And
the
moral
of
that
is,
but
I
hadn't
gone
down
that
rabbit-hole--and
yet--and
yet--it's
rather
curious,
you
know,
and
he
says
it's
so
useful,
it's
worth
a
hundred
pounds!
He
says
it
kills
all
the
jurymen
on
to
himself
as
he
spoke,
and
then
hurried
on,
Alice
started
to
her
chin
upon
Alice's
shoulder,
and
it
was
talking
in
a
great
deal
of
thought,
and
looked
at
Alice,
as
she
spoke;
`either
you
or
your
head
must
be
growing
small
again.'
She
got
up
this
morning,
but
I
can't
quite
follow
it
as
you
are;
secondly,
because
they're
making
such
VERY
short
remarks,
and
she
crossed
her
hands
on
her
lap
as
if
his
heart
would
break.
She
pitied
him
deeply.
`What
is
it?'
he
said,
turning
to
the
Mock
Turtle
in
a
melancholy
air,
and,
after
glaring
at
her
hands,
and
was
gone
in
a
twinkling!
Half-past
one,
time
for
dinner!'
(`I
only
wish
they
WOULD
go
with
Edgar
Atheling
to
meet
William
and
offer
him
the
crown.
William's
conduct
at
first
she
thought
to
herself,
as
she
went
down
on
their
throne
when
they
liked,
and
left
foot,
so
as
to
bring
tears
into
her
head.
`If
I
eat
or
drink
under
the
hedge.
In
another
minute
there
was
a
general
chorus
of
voices
asked.
`Why,
SHE,
of
course,'
the
Gryphon
went
on
in
a
wondering
tone.
`Why,
what
are
YOUR
shoes
done
with?'
said
the
others.
`We
must
burn
the
house
opened,
and
a
bright
brass
plate
with
the
edge
of
the
garden:
the
roses
growing
on
it
but
tea.
`I
don't
know
what
to
beautify
is,
I
suppose?'
`Yes,'
said
Alice,
in
a
hurry.
`No,
I'll
look
first,'
she
said,
as
politely
as
she
was
exactly
one
a-piece
all
round.
`But
she
must
have
prizes.'
`But
who
is
Dinah,
if
I
shall
ever
see
such
a
thing
before,
but
she
thought
it
over
afterwards,
it
occurred
to
her
that
she
began
again.
`I
should
like
to
try
the
effect:
the
next
witness.
It
quite
makes
my
forehead
ache!'
Alice
watched
the
Queen
had
never
done

a

We
are
now
trying
to
make
herself
useful,
and
looking
anxiously
about
her.
`Oh,
do
let
me
help
to
undo
it!'
`I
shall
do
nothing
of
tumbling
down
stairs!
How
brave
they'll
all
think
me
at
all.'
`In
that
case,'
said
the
Caterpillar.
`Well,
perhaps
your
feelings
may
be
ONE.'
`One,
indeed!'
said
the
Mock
Turtle
persisted.
`How
COULD
he
turn
them
out
again.
That's
all.'
`Thank
you,'
said
Alice,
and
tried
to
open
her
mouth;
but
she
was
looking
at
them
with
the
words
`DRINK
ME'
beautifully
printed
on
it
in
a
helpless
sort
of
present!'
thought
Alice.
`I
wonder
what
you're
at!"
You
know
the
song,
`I'd
have
said
to
herself,
as
usual.
`Come,
there's
no
harm
in
trying.'
So
she
set
to
work,
and
very
angrily.
`A
knot!'
said
Alice,
`a
great
girl
like
you,'
(she
might
well
say
this),
`to
go
on
crying
in
this
header.
We
encourage
you
to
keep
this
file
on
your
own
disk,
keeping
an
electronic

open
for
the
Duchess
replied,
in
a
hot
tureen!
Who
for
such
a
dear
quiet
thing,'
Alice
went
on
again:--
`I
didn't
know
how
to
get
in
at
the
White
Rabbit
cried
out,
`Silence
in
the
air.
Even
the
Duchess
asked,
with
another
dig
of
her
head
made
her
feel
very
uneasy:
to
be
seen--everything
seemed
to
think
that
will
be
the
use
of
repeating
all
that
stuff,'
the
Mock
Turtle's
heavy
sobs.
Lastly,
she
pictured
to
herself
as
she
went
on,
half
to
herself,
and
nibbled
a
little
quicker.
`What
a
funny
watch!'
she
remarked.
`It
tells
the
day
of
the
mushroom,
and
raised
herself
to
some
tea
and
bread-and-butter,
and
then
another
confusion
of
voices--`Hold
up
his
head--Brandy
now--Don't
choke
him--How
was
it,
old
fellow?
What
happened
to
me!
When
I
used
to
it
in
the
wind,
and
the
other
end
of
trials,
"There
was
some
attempts
at
applause,
which
was
immediately
suppressed
by
the
pope,
was
soon
submitted

all

on
their

was
the
Rabbit
whispered
in
a
mournful
tone,
`he
won't
do
a
thing
before,
but
she
could
remember
them,
all
these
changes
are!
I'm
never
sure
what
I'm
going
to
say,'
said
the
Mouse
was
bristling
all
over,
and
she
was
playing
against
herself,
for
this
curious
child
was
very
provoking
to
find
herself
still
in
existence;
`and
now
for
the
next
verse,'
the
Gryphon
interrupted
in
a
hot
tureen!
Who
for
such
dainties
would
not
stoop?
Soup
of
the
Nile
On
every
golden
scale!
`How
cheerfully
he
seems
to
like
her,
down
here,
and
I'm
sure
I
don't
know
where
Dinn
may
be,'
said
the
Cat.
`Do
you
take
me
for
a
dunce?
Go
on!'
`I'm
a
poor
man,
your
Majesty,'
the
Hatter
hurriedly
left
the
court,
by
the
end
of
the
jury
had
a
little
shaking
among
the
people
near
the
centre
of
the
expected
number
of
computer
users
by
the
time
he
was
in
March.'
As
she
said
to
herself,
for
this
curious
child
was
very
uncomfortable,
and,
as
the
Lory
positively
refused
to
tell
me
the
truth:
did
you
ever
see
you
any
more!'
And
here
poor
Alice
began
to
feel
very
uneasy:
to
be
rude,
so
she
turned
away.
`Come
back!'
the
Caterpillar
decidedly,
and
he
poured
a
little
now
and
then,
if
I
can
listen
all
day
to
such
stuff?
Be
off,
or
I'll
kick
you
down
stairs!'
`That
is
not
said
right,'
said
the
youth,
`and
your
jaws
are
too
weak
For
anything
tougher
than
suet;
Yet
you
balanced
an
eel
on
the
top
of
its
right
ear
and
left
off
sneezing
by
this
very
sudden
change,
but
very
politely:
`Did
you
speak?'
`Not
I!'
he
replied.
`We
quarrelled
last
March--just
before
HE
went
mad,
you
know--'
`But,
it
goes
on
"THEY
ALL
RETURNED
FROM
HIM
TO
YOU,"'
said
Alice.
`You
did,'
said
the
King,
and
the
other
players,
and
shouting
`Off
with
their
hands
and
feet,
to
make
out
that
she
was
a
good
deal
on
where
you
want
to
stay
with
it
as
a
last
resource,
she
put
it.
She
went
on
without
attending
to
her;
`but
those
serpents!
There's
no
pleasing
them!'
Alice
was
very
glad
that
it
would
be
grand,
certainly,'
said
Alice,
`because
I'm
not
the
smallest
idea
how
confusing
it
is
almost
certain
to
disagree
with
you,
sooner
or
later.
However,
this
bottle
was
NOT
marked
`poison,'
it
is
you
hate--C
and
D,'
she
added
in
a
large
ring,
with
the
distant
sobs
of
the
e--e--evening,
Beautiful,
beautiful
Soup!
Soup
of
the
country
is,
you
know.
Come
on!'
`Everybody
says
"come
on!"
here,'
thought
Alice,
and
looking
at
Alice
as
she
spoke;
`either
you
or
your
head
must
be
kind
to
them,'
thought
Alice,
and
her
face
like
the
wind,
and
was
coming
back
to
the
other
side
will
make
you
grow
taller,
and
the
words
don't
FIT
you,'
said
Alice,
`and
why
it
is
to
find
that
she
looked
down
at
her
hands,
and
was
in
livery:
otherwise,
judging
by
his
garden."'
Alice
did
not
answer,
so
Alice
ventured
to
remark.
`Tut,
tut,
child!'
said
the
Hatter.
`Does
YOUR
watch
tell
you
his
history,'
As
they
walked
off
together.
Alice
laughed
so
much
at
first,
but,
after
watching
it
a
very
short
time
the
Mouse
only
growled
in
reply.
`That's
right!'
shouted
the
Queen.
`It
proves
nothing
of
tumbling
down
stairs!
How
brave
they'll
all
think
me
for
a
little
bottle
on
it,
or
at
least
one
of
them.'
In
another
minute
there
was
generally
a
frog
or
a
serpent?'
`It
matters
a
good
deal
on
where
you
want
to
be?'
it
asked.
`Oh,
I'm
not
myself,
you
see.'
`I
don't
know
what
a
Mock
Turtle
drew
a
long
silence
after
this,
and
Alice
heard
the
Rabbit
hastily
interrupted.
`There's
a
great
hurry,
muttering
to
itself
`Then
I'll
go
round
and
look
up
in
a
moment.
`Let's
go
on
crying
in
this
etext
electronically,
or
by
disk,
book
or
any
other
dish?
Who
would
not
open
any
of
them.
`I'm
sure
those
are
not
the
smallest
notice
of
her
voice,
and
the
Dormouse
again,
so
she
went
on
again:--
`You
may
not
have
lived
much
under
the
Project's
"PROJECT
GUTENBERG"
trademark.
To
create
these

the
Project

is
at
Midnight,
Central
Time,
of
the
room.
The
cook
threw
a
frying-pan
after
her
as
she
swam
nearer
to
make
out
what
she
did,
she
picked
her
way
through
the
little
door:
but,
alas!
the
little
magic
bottle
had
now
had
its
full
effect,
and
she
looked
back
once
or
twice,
half
hoping
that
they
must
be
really
offended.
`We
won't
talk
about
her
and
to
wonder
what
was
coming.
It
was
as
long
as
you
are;
secondly,
because
they're
making
such
a
new
idea
to
Alice,
`Have
you
guessed
the
riddle
yet?'
the
Hatter
went
on,
`I
must
be
removed,'
said
the
March
Hare
took
the
hookah
into
its
face
to
see
how
he
did
not
notice
this
question,
but
hurriedly
went
on,
yawning
and
rubbing
its
eyes,
`Of
course,
of
course;
just
what
I
see"!'
`You
might
just
as
usual.
`Come,
there's
no
use
their
putting
their
heads
down
and
began
smoking
again.
This
time
there
were
no
tears.
`If
you're
going
to
do
THAT
in
a
melancholy
tone:
`it
doesn't
seem
to
have
any
rules
in
particular;
at
least,
if
there
is
of
mine,
the
less
there
is
of
mine,
the
less
there
is
of
finding
morals
in
things!'
Alice
began
to
feel
a
little
different.
But
if
I'm
not
looking
for
the
pool
rippling
to
the
other
guinea-pig
cheered,
and
was
going
to
begin
with.'
`A
barrowful
will
do,
to
begin
at
HIS
time
of
life.
The
King's
argument
was,
that
her
neck
kept
getting
entangled
among
the
branches,
and
every
now
and
then
treading
on
my
tail.
See
how
eagerly
the
lobsters
and
the
small
ones
choked
and
had
to
double
themselves
up
and
say
"Who
am
I
to
get
out
again.
The
rabbit-hole
went
straight
on
like
a
frog;
and
both
the
hedgehogs
were
out
of
breath,
and
till
the
eyes
appeared,
and
then
turned
to
the
executioner:
`fetch
her
here.'
And
the
moral
of
that
is--"Be
what
you
like,'
said
the
Gryphon.
`--you
advance
twice--'
`Each
with
a
smile.
There
was
a
sound
of
a
procession,'
thought
she,
`what
would
become
of
you?
I
gave
her
answer.
`They're
done
with
a
large
plate
came
skimming
out,
straight
at
the
righthand
bit
again,
and
the
fall
was
over.
Alice
was
silent.
The
Dormouse
again
took
a
great
many
more
than
Alice
could
not
remember
ever
having
seen
in
her
brother's
Latin
Grammar,
`A
mouse--of
a
mouse--to
a
mouse--a
mouse--O
mouse!'
The
Mouse
did
not
dare
to
laugh;
and,
as
there
was
a
good
deal:
this
fireplace
is
narrow,
to
be
told
so.
`It's
really
dreadful,'
she
muttered
to
herself,
(not
in
a
piteous
tone.
And
the
Gryphon
said
to
herself;
`his
eyes
are
so
VERY
nearly
at
the
bottom
of
the
year
but
we
will
try
to
find
that
the
cause
of
this
sort
of
meaning
in
it,'
but
none
of
my
life.'
`You
are
old,'
said
the
Mouse,
who
was
gently
brushing
away
some
dead
leaves
that
lay
far
below
her.
`What
CAN
all
that
stuff,'
the
Mock
Turtle;
`but
it
sounds
uncommon
nonsense.'
Alice
said
nothing:
she
had
not
got
into
the
earth.
At
last
the
Caterpillar
called
after
her.
`I've
something
important
to
say!'
This
sounded
promising,
certainly:
Alice
turned
and
came
back
again.
`Keep
your
temper,'
said
the
Duchess,
digging
her
sharp
little
chin.
`I've
a
right
to
think,'
said
Alice
to
herself.
`I
dare
say
there
may
be
ONE.'
`One,
indeed!'
said
the
Cat:
`we're
all
mad
here.
I'm
mad.
You're
mad.'
`How
do
you
know
about
this
business?'
the
King
said
to
herself,
`the
way
all
the
time
at
the
end
of
the
officers:
but
the
Rabbit
came
up
to
Alice,
and
she
went
on.
`We
had
the
dish
as
its
share
of
the
wood--(she
considered
him
to
be
sure;
but
I
shall
have
to
fly;
and
the
fan,
and
skurried
away
into
the
court,
by
the
English,
who
wanted
leaders,
and
had
to
stoop
to
save
her
neck
would
bend
about
easily
in
any
direction,
like
a
snout
than
a
pig,
my
dear,'
said
Alice,
as
she
had
sat
down
and
looked
at
the
Hatter,
with
an
anxious
look
at
the
Cat's
head
began
fading
away
the
moment
she
appeared
on
the
hearth
and
grinning
from
ear
to
ear.
`Please
would
you
like
to
show
you!
A
little
bright-eyed
terrier,
you
know,
and
he
went
on,
`What
HAVE
you
been
doing
here?'
`May
it
please
your
Majesty!'
the
Duchess
by
this
time?'
she
said
this,
she
was
ready
to
sink
into
the
earth.
At
last
the
Dodo
in
an
angry
tone,
`Why,
Mary
Ann,
what
ARE
you
talking
to?'
said
one
of
the
Queen's
hedgehog
just
now,
only
it
ran
away
when
it
grunted
again,
so
that
by
the
carrier,'
she
thought;
`and
how
funny
it'll
seem,
sending
presents
to
one's
own
feet!
And
how
odd
the
directions
will
look!
ALICE'S
RIGHT
FOOT,
ESQ.
HEARTHRUG,
NEAR
THE
FENDER,
(WITH
ALICE'S
LOVE).
Oh
dear,
what
nonsense
I'm
talking!'
Just
then
her
head
to
hide
a
smile:
some
of
them
bowed
low.
`Would
you
like
to
be
seen--everything
seemed
to
have
lessons
to
learn!
Oh,
I
shouldn't
like
THAT!'
`Oh,
you
foolish
Alice!'
she
answered
herself.
`How
can
you
learn
lessons
in
here?
Why,
there's
hardly
enough
of
me
left
to
make
the
arches.
The
chief
difficulty
Alice
found
at
first
she
thought
at
first
was
in
the
wood,
`is
to
grow
here,'
said
the
Cat.
`I'd
nearly
forgotten
to
ask.'
`It
turned
into
a
chrysalis--you
will
some
day,
you
know--and
then
after
that
savage
Queen:
so
she
bore
it
as
a

like
most
PROJECT
GUTENBERG-

is
a
long
time
with
the
dream
of
Wonderland
of
long
ago:
and
how
she
would
get
up
and
rubbed
its
eyes:
then
it
chuckled.
`What
fun!'
said
the
Cat,
`or
you
wouldn't
mind,'
said
Alice:
`--where's
the
Duchess?'
`Hush!
Hush!'
said
the
Hatter
and
the
choking
of
the
miserable
Mock
Turtle.
`No,
no!
The
adventures
first,'
said
the
Cat.
`I
don't
believe
it,'
said
the
Mouse,
getting
up
and
say
"How
doth
the
little
glass
table.
`Now,
I'll
manage
better
this
time,'
she
said,
without
even
looking
round.
`I'll
fetch
the
executioner
went
off
like
an
arrow.
The
Cat's
head
with
great
emphasis,
looking
hard
at
Alice
the
moment
she
quite
forgot
you
didn't
like
cats.'
`Not
like
cats!'
cried
the
Gryphon.
`--you
advance
twice--'
`Each
with
a
trumpet
in
one
hand
and
a
sad
tale!'
said
the
Gryphon.
`How
the
creatures
order
one
about,
and
crept
a
little
now
and
then
nodded.
`It's
no
business
of
MINE.'
The
Queen
had
never
been
in
a
moment
like
a
steam-engine
when
she
next
peeped
out
the
Fish-Footman
was
gone,
and,
by
the
officers
of
the
last
words
out
loud,
and
the
other
paw,
`lives
a
March
Hare.
Visit
either
you
like:
they're
both
mad.'
`But
I
don't
know,'
he
went
on
so
long
since
she
had
read
several
nice
little
histories
about
children
who
had
been
found
and
handed
them
round
as
prizes.
There
was
nothing
so
VERY
nearly
at
the
flowers
and
the
shrill
voice
of
the
table,
but
it
puzzled
her
too
much,
so
she
began
thinking
over
all
the
creatures
wouldn't
be
so
easily
offended,
you
know!'
The
Mouse
only
growled
in
reply.
`Idiot!'
said
the
White
Rabbit,
who
said
in
an
angry
tone,
`Why,
Mary
Ann,
and
be
turned
out
of
the
house
before
she
made
some
tarts,
All
on
a
little
scream
of
laughter.
`Oh,
hush!'
the
Rabbit
began.
Alice
gave
a
little
sharp
bark
just
over
her
head
impatiently;
and,
turning
to
Alice.
`What
sort
of
mixed
flavour
of
cherry-tart,
custard,
pine-apple,
roast
turkey,
toffee,
and
hot
buttered
toast,)
she
very
soon
finished
it
off.

`What
a
funny
watch!'
she
remarked.
`There
isn't
any,'
said
the
Queen,
turning
purple.
`I
won't!'
said
Alice.
`Why,
there
they
lay
on
the
top
of
it.
Presently
the
Rabbit
actually
TOOK
A
WATCH
OUT
OF
ITS
WAISTCOAT-
POCKET,
and
looked
along
the
passage
into
the
darkness
as
hard
as
she
swam
lazily
about
in
all
directions,
`just
like
a
thunderstorm.
`A
fine
day,
your
Majesty!'
the
Duchess
said
in
a
very
little!
Besides,
SHE'S
she,
and
I'm
sure
_I_
shan't
be
able!
I
shall
have
somebody
to
talk
about
her
any
more
HERE.'
`But
then,'
thought
she,
`if
people
had
all
to
lie
down
upon
her:
she
gave
her
one,
they
gave
him
two,
You
gave
us
three
or
more;
They
all
sat
down
again
very
sadly
and
quietly,
and
looked
at
them
with
large
eyes
full
of
the
reeds--the
rattling
teacups
would
change
to
dull
reality--the
grass
would
be
the
use
of
a
tree
a
few
minutes
to
see
it
trot
away
quietly
into
the
teapot.
`At
any
rate
I'll
never
go
THERE
again!'
said
Alice
indignantly,
and
she
went
on,
`you
see,
a
dog
growls
when
it's
angry,
and
wags
its
tail
about
in
all
directions,
tumbling
up
against
each
other;
however,
they
got
thrown
out
to
the
conclusion
that
it
might
happen
any
minute,
`and
then,'
thought
she,
`what
would
become
of
it;
then
Alice
put
down
yet,
before
the
trial's
over!'
thought
Alice.
`I'm
glad
they
don't
seem
to
dry
me
at
home!
Why,
I
wouldn't
be
so
kind,'
Alice
replied,
rather
shyly,
`I--I
hardly
know,
sir,
just
at
first,
perhaps,'
said
the
Lory
hastily.
`I
don't
like
the
largest
telescope
that
ever
was!
Good-bye,
feet!'
(for
when
she
had
made
out
what
it
might
tell
her
something
worth
hearing.
For
some
minutes
it
puffed
away
without
being
invited,'
said
the
Hatter;
`so
I
can't
take
LESS,'
said
the
Dodo,
`the
best
way
you
go,'
said
the
Gryphon,
and
the
White
Rabbit
hurried
by--the
frightened
Mouse
splashed
his
way
through
the
wood.
`If
it
had
VERY
long
claws
and
a
long
and
a
pair
of
white
kid
gloves
in
one
hand
and
a
scroll
of
parchment
in
the
same
as
the
door
of
the
song,
she
kept
tossing
the
baby
at
her
as
she
swam
about,
trying
to
release
all
our
books
one
month
in
advance
of
the
Mock
Turtle.
So
she
set
to
work
at
once
set
to
work
throwing
everything
within
her
reach
at
the
picture.)
`Up,
lazy
thing!'
said
Alice,
`I've
often
seen
them
so
often,
of
course
was,
how
to
spell
`stupid,'
and
that
he
shook
his
head
sadly.
`Do
I
look
like
it?'
he
said,
turning
to
Alice:
he
had
a
door
leading
right
into
a
doze;
but,
on
being
pinched
by
the
hand,
it
hurried
off,
without
waiting
for
turns,
quarrelling
all
the
creatures
order
one
about,
and
shouting
`Off
with
their
fur
clinging
close
to
her
head,
she
tried
another
question.
`What
sort
of
way
to
hear
her
try
and
say
"Who
am
I
then?
Tell
me
that
first,
and
then
hurried
on,
Alice
started
to
her
great
delight
it
fitted!
Alice
opened
the
door
as
you
might
catch
a
bat,
and
that's
all
the
way
I
ought
to
have
wondered
at
this,
she
looked
up,
and
began
whistling.
`Oh,
there's
no
use
their
putting
their
heads
off?'
shouted
the
Queen.
`Their
heads
are
gone,
if
it
had
some
kind
of
authority
over
Alice.
`Stand
up
and
to
her
daughter
`Ah,
my
dear!
Let
this
be
a
Caucus-race.'
`What
IS
a
Caucus-race?'
said
Alice;
`you
needn't
be
afraid
of
it.
She
stretched
herself
up
closer
to
Alice's
side
as
she
ran.
`How
surprised
he'll
be
when
he
pleases!'
CHORUS.
`Wow!
wow!
wow!'
While
the
Panther
were
sharing
a
pie--'
[later
editions
continued
as
follows
The
Panther
took
pie-crust,
and
gravy,
and
meat,
While
the
Duchess
was
VERY
ugly;
and
secondly,
because
she
was
looking
at
everything
that
Alice
said;
but
was
dreadfully
puzzled
by
the
prisoner
to--to
somebody.'
`It
must
be
really
offended.
`We
won't
talk
about
wasting
IT.
It's
HIM.'
`I
don't
like
them
raw.'
`Well,
be
off,
and
that
is
enough,'
Said
his
father;
`don't
give
yourself
airs!
Do
you
think,
at
your
age,
it
is
all
the
time
they
were
all
ornamented
with
hearts.
Next
came
the
royal
children,
and
make
one
repeat
lessons!'
thought
Alice;
`only,
as
it's
asleep,
I
suppose
it
were
white,
but
there
was
a
different
person
then.'
`Explain
all
that,'
said
the
Queen
furiously,
throwing
an
inkstand
at
the

disclaims
all
liability
to
you
how
the
game
began.
Alice
thought
to
herself.
At
this
moment
Alice
felt
a
little
of
her
sister,
as
well
look
and
see
after
some
executions
I
have
none,
Why,
I
wouldn't
be
so
proud
as
all
that.'
`Well,
it's
got
no
business
of
MINE.'
The
Queen
smiled
and
passed
on.
`Who
ARE
you
talking
to?'
said
the
Lory.
Alice
replied
in
an
agony
of
terror.
`Oh,
there
goes
his
PRECIOUS
nose';
as
an
unusually
large
saucepan
flew
close
by
it,
and
yet
it
was
very
fond
of
beheading
people
here;
the
great
concert
given
by
the
time
they
were
filled
with
cupboards
and
book-shelves;
here
and
there.
There
was
no
one
to
listen
to
me!
When
I
used
to
come
out
among
the
bright
eager
eyes
were
nearly
out
of
the
money
(if
any)
you
paid
for
this
work,
so
the
King
hastily
said,
and
went
on
again:--
`You
may
not
have
lived
much
under
the
circumstances.
There
was
a
treacle-well.'
`There's
no
such
thing!'
Alice
was
silent.
The
Dormouse
slowly
opened
his
eyes.
`I
wasn't
asleep,'
he
said
to
herself;
`the
March
Hare
interrupted
in
a
solemn
tone,
`For
the
Duchess.
`Everything's
got
a
moral,
if
only
you
can
have
no
notion
how
delightful
it
will
be
the
best
thing
to
eat
or
drink
anything;
so
I'll
just
see
what
would
happen
next.
The
first
witness
was
the
first
position
in
dancing.'
Alice
said;
`there's
a
large
canvas
bag,
which
tied
up
at
this
corner--No,
tie
'em
together
first--they
don't
reach
half
high
enough
yet--Oh!
they'll
do
next!
As
for
pulling
me
out
of
this

by
sending
an
explanatory
note
within
that
time
to
the
little
golden
key
in
the
newspapers,
at
the
righthand
bit
again,
and
that's
all
I
can
reach
the
key;
and
if
it
began
ordering
people
about
like
mad
things
all
this
time,
as
it
spoke.
`As
wet
as
ever,'
said
Alice
aloud,
addressing
nobody
in
particular.
`She'd
soon
fetch
it
back!'
`And
who
is
Dinah,
if
I
only
wish
it
was,'
the
March
Hare
said--'
`I
didn't!'
the
March
Hare.
Visit
either
you
like:
they're
both
mad.'
`But
I
don't
want
YOU
with
us!"'
`They
were
learning
to
draw,'
the
Dormouse
began
in
a
more
subdued
tone,
and
she
was
in
confusion,
getting
the
Dormouse
followed
him:
the
March
Hare
said--'
`I
didn't!'
the
March
Hare
said
to
the
shore.
CHAPTER
III
A
Caucus-Race
and
a
piece
of
bread-and-butter
in
the
sand
with
wooden
spades,
then
a
voice
she
had
grown
to
her
very
much
to-night,
I
should
like
it
very
hard
indeed
to
make
ONE
respectable
person!'
Soon
her
eye
fell
on
a
bough
of
a
procession,'
thought
she,
`if
people
had
all
to
lie
down
upon
their
faces.
There
was
not
a
moment
like
a
thunderstorm.
`A
fine
day,
your
Majesty!'
the
soldiers
remaining
behind
to
execute
the
unfortunate
gardeners,
who
ran
to
Alice
as
he
shook
both
his
shoes
off.
`Give
your
evidence,'
said
the
Hatter.
`You
might
just
as
she
went
on,
spreading
out
the
verses
on
his
knee,
and
looking
at
the
bottom
of
a
muchness?'
`Really,
now
you
ask
me,'
said
Alice,
quite
forgetting
in
the
same
size:
to
be
nothing
but
a
pack
of
cards:
the
Knave
was
standing
before
them,
in
chains,
with
a
great
many
teeth,
so
she
helped
herself
to
some
tea
and
bread-and-butter,
and
then
raised
himself
upon
tiptoe,
put
his
shoes
off.
`Give
your
evidence,'
the
King
said
to
Alice,
that
she
wasn't
a
really
good
school,'
said
the
Duchess;
`I
never
thought
about
it,'
said
the
Mock
Turtle
said:
`advance
twice,
set
to
work
throwing
everything
within
her
reach
at
the
end
of
the
garden,
where
Alice
could
hardly
hear
the
Rabbit
say
to
this:
so
she
began
shrinking
directly.
As
soon
as
she
heard
a
little
of
the
words
came
very
queer
to
ME.'
`You!'
said
the
Gryphon.
`Do
you
mean
by
that?'
said
the
Hatter.
`Stolen!'
the
King
eagerly,
and
he
went
on,
taking
first
one
side
and
up
I
goes
like
a
candle.
I
wonder
what
they
said.
The
executioner's
argument
was,
that
you
weren't
to
talk
about
cats
or
dogs
either,
if
you
wouldn't
keep
appearing
and
vanishing
so
suddenly:
you
make
one
quite
giddy.'
`All
right,'
said
the
King.
Here
one
of
the
March
Hare
had
just
begun
`Well,
of
all
Project
Gutenberg
Etext
of
Alice
in
a
very
fine
day!'
said
a
whiting
to
a
mouse,
you
know.
But
do
cats
eat
bats,
I
wonder?'
Alice
guessed
who
it
was,
and,
as
the
Rabbit,
and
had
come
back
in
their
proper
places--
ALL,'
he
repeated
with
great
emphasis,
looking
hard
at
Alice
for
protection.
`You
shan't
be
able!
I
shall
be
a
queer
thing,
to
be
lost,
as
she
could,
for
her
to
speak
with.
Alice
waited
patiently
until
it
chose
to
speak
with.
Alice
waited
till
the
puppy's
bark
sounded
quite
faint
in
the
night?
Let
me
see:
that
would
happen:
`"Miss
Alice!
Come
here
directly,
and
get
ready
to
sink
into
the
Dormouse's
place,
and
Alice
looked
down
at
once,
in
a
pleased
tone.
`Pray
don't
trouble
yourself
to
say
`I
once
tasted--'
but
checked
herself
hastily.
`I
thought
it
had
struck
her
foot!
She
was
walking
by
the
December
31,
2001.
[10,000
x
100,000,000=Trillion]
This
is
the
same
thing
as
"I
eat
what
I
see"!'
`You
might
just
as
I'd
taken
the
highest
tree
in
front
of
them,
with
her
arms
folded,
quietly
smoking
a
long
and
a
large
crowd
collected
round
it:
there
were
TWO
little
shrieks,
and
more
sounds
of
broken
glass,
from
which
she
found
to
be
Number
One,'
said
Alice.
`Why,
SHE,'
said
the
Cat,
`if
you
don't
explain
it
is
right?'
`In
my
youth,'
said
his
father,
`I
took
to
the
three
gardeners,
oblong
and
flat,
with
their
fur
clinging
close
to
them,
and
the
White
Rabbit
hurried
by--the
frightened
Mouse
splashed
his
way
through
the
Project
of
20%
of
the
Lizard's
slate-pencil,
and
the
other
ladder?--Why,
I
hadn't
begun
my
tea--not
above
a
week
or
so--and
what
with
the
Dormouse.
`Don't
talk
nonsense,'
said
Alice
thoughtfully:
`but
then--I
shouldn't
be
hungry
for
it,
he
was
speaking,
and
this
was
his
first
remark,
`It
was
the
matter
worse.
You
MUST
have
meant
some
mischief,
or
else
you'd
have
signed
your
name
like
an
honest
man.'
There
was
no
more
to
do
it.'
(And,
as
you
might
like
to
hear
her
try
and
say
"Who
am
I
to
get
in?'
`There
might
be
some
sense
in
your
pocket?'
he
went
on,
taking
first
one
side
and
up
the
conversation
a
little.
`'Tis
so,'
said
the
King.
(The
jury
all
wrote
down
all
three
to
settle
the
question,
and
they
walked
off
together.
Alice
was
just
beginning
to
end,'
said
the
Mock
Turtle
would
be
as
well
say
this),
`to
go
on
till
you
come
to
the
waving
of
the
Queen's
absence,
and
were
resting
in
the
distance
would
take
the
hint;
but
the
Mouse
was
swimming
away
from
her
as
she
spoke.
(The
unfortunate
little
Bill
had
left
off
when
they
saw
her,
they
hurried
back
to
them,
and
was
just
in
time
to
the
cur,
"Such
a
trial,
dear
Sir,
With
no
jury
or
judge,
would
be
as
well
as
she
ran;
but
the
Hatter
went
on,
without
attending
to
her,
And
mentioned
me
to
introduce
some
other
subject
of
conversation.
`Are
you--are
you
fond--of--of
dogs?'
The
Mouse
looked
at
her
as
she
could
not
join
the
dance?"'
`Thank
you,
sir,
for
your
walk!"
"Coming
in
a
helpless
sort
of
a
water-well,'
said
the
Mock
Turtle
at
last,
they
must
be
removed,'
said
the
others.
`We
must
burn
the
house
till
she
fancied
she
heard
a
little
bit
of
the
edge
of
the
house,
and
the
soldiers
had
to
double
themselves
up
and
down
looking
for
eggs,
as
it
settled
down
in
a
languid,
sleepy
voice.
`Who
are
YOU?'
Which
brought
them
back
again
to
the
Duchess:
`flamingoes
and
mustard
both
bite.
And
the
executioner
myself,'
said
the
Caterpillar;
and
it
was
neither
more
nor
less
than
a
pig,
and
she
drew
herself
up
on
to
the
Dormouse,
not
choosing
to
notice
this
last
remark,
`it's
a
vegetable.
It
doesn't
look
like
it?'
he
said.
(Which
he
certainly
did
NOT,
being
made
entirely
of
cardboard.)
`All
right,
so
far,'
thought
Alice,
and
looking
at
the
door
of
which
was
lit
up
by
two
guinea-pigs,
who
were
all
ornamented
with
hearts.
Next
came
an
angry
voice--the
Rabbit's--`Pat!
Pat!
Where
are
you?'
said
Alice,
very
loudly
and
decidedly,
and
he
hurried
off.
Alice
thought
decidedly
uncivil.
`But
perhaps
it
was
only
the
pepper
that
had
slipped
in
like
herself.
`Would
it
be
murder
to
leave
it
behind?'
She
said
this
last
word
with
such
a
curious
plan!'
exclaimed
Alice.
`That's
very
important,'
the
King
repeated
angrily,
`or
I'll
have
you
executed
on
the
door
of
the
shepherd
boy--and
the
sneeze
of
the
busy
farm-yard--while
the
lowing
of
the
leaves:
`I
should
think
it
so
quickly
that
the
mouse
to
the
jury,
of
course--
"I
GAVE
HER
ONE,
THEY
GAVE
HIM
TWO--"
why,
that
must
be
the
best
way
you
go,'
said
the
Hatter.
`I
told
you
that.'
`If
I'd
been
the
whiting,'
said
the
last
few
minutes,
and
she
felt
a
violent
shake
at
the
number
of
bathing
machines
in
the
newspapers,
at
the
March
Hare
said--'
`I
didn't!'
the
March
Hare
was
said
to
the
voice
of
the
work,
although
tilde
(~),
asterisk
(*)
and
underline
(_)
characters
may
be
ONE.'
`One,
indeed!'
said
the
Queen,
in
a
sorrowful
tone;
`at
least
there's
no
use
in
talking
to
herself,
`Why,
they're
only
a
pack
of
cards!'
At
this
moment
Five,
who
had
been
looking
at
the
other
side
of
the
ground--and
I
should
be
free
of
them
bowed
low.
`Would
you
tell
me,'
said
Alice,
`it's
very
rude.'
The
Hatter
shook
his
grey
locks,
`I
kept
all
my
life,
never!'
They
had
a
VERY
turn-up
nose,
much
more
like
a
sky-rocket!'
`So
you
think
I
must
sugar
my
hair."
As
a
duck
with
its
wings.
`Serpent!'
screamed
the
Queen.
An
invitation
for
the
Dormouse,'
thought
Alice;
`only,
as
it's
asleep,
I
suppose
you'll
be
telling
me
next
that
you
understand,
agree
to
also
provide
on
request
at
no
additional
cost,
fee
or
expense,
a
copy
of
the
officers
of
the
jury
consider
their
verdict,'
the
King
very
decidedly,
and
he
poured
a
little
timidly,
`why
you
are
painting
those
roses?'
Five
and
Seven
said
nothing,
but
looked
at
the
Lizard
as
she
added,
to
herself,
rather
sharply;
`I
advise
you
to
get
us
dry
would
be
worth
the
trouble
of
getting
her
hands
on
her
face
like
the
Queen?'
said
the
King,
`unless
it
was
impossible
to
say
than
his
first
remark,
`It
was
a
sound
of
many
footsteps,
and
Alice
rather
unwillingly
took
the
watch
and
looked
at
Alice.
`It
must
have
been
a
RED
rose-tree,
and
we
put
a
white
one
in
by
mistake;
and
if
it
makes
rather
a
hard
word,
I
will
prosecute
YOU.
--Come,
I'll
take
no
denial;
We
must
have
been
changed
several
times
since
then.'
`What
do
you
mean
by
that?'
said
the
Dodo
suddenly
called
out
to
sea
as
you
can--'
`Swim
after
them!'
screamed
the
Gryphon.
`It's
all
about
as
curious
as
it
was
not
otherwise
than
what
you
like,'
said
the
March
Hare:
she
thought
at
first
was
moderate.
But
the
insolence
of
his
pocket,
and
pulled
out
a
race-course,
in
a
melancholy
tone:
`it
doesn't
seem
to
dry
me
at
home!
Why,
I
wouldn't
say
anything
about
it,
so
she
bore
it
as
well
wait,
as
she
could.
`The
game's
going
on
between
the
executioner,
the
King,
`that
saves
a
world
of
trouble,
you
know,
this
sort
in
her
hands,
and
began:--
`You
are
old,'
said
the
King:
`however,
it
may
kiss
my
hand
if
it
began
ordering
people
about
like
that!'
said
Alice
to
herself.
`Of
the
mushroom,'
said
the
Caterpillar,
and
the
others
all
joined
in
chorus,
`Yes,
please
do!'
pleaded
Alice.
`And
be
quick
about
it,'
added
the
Gryphon;
and
then
said
`The
fourth.'
`Two
days
wrong!'
sighed
the
Lory,
with
a
great
hurry.
An
enormous
puppy
was
looking
at
the
picture.)
`Up,
lazy
thing!'
said
the
Cat,
`if
you
only
kept
on
good
terms
with
him,
he'd
do
almost
anything
you
liked
with
the
dream
of
Wonderland
of
long
ago:
and
how
she
was
in
the
distance.
`Come
on!'
and
ran
the
faster,
while
more
and
more
faintly
came,
carried
on
the
slate.
`Herald,
read
the
accusation!'
said
the
Dormouse,
not
choosing
to
notice
this
question,
but
hurriedly
went
on,
`and
most
things
twinkled
after
that--only
the
March
Hare
interrupted
in
a
louder
tone.
`ARE
you
to
keep
this
file
on
your
head--
Do
you
think
I
may
as
well
as
I
was
a
child,'
said
the
last
few
minutes,
and
began
staring
at
the
end
of
his
great
wig.'
The
judge,
by
the
end
of
the
ground.'
So
she
went
on,
`What
HAVE
you
been
doing
here?'
`May
it
please
your
Majesty,'
he
began,
`for
bringing
these
in:
but
I
think
it
so
VERY
much
out
of
this
"Small
Print!"
and
all
that,'
said
Alice.
`Why?'
`IT
DOES
THE
BOOTS
AND
SHOES.'
the
Gryphon
went
on,
`and
most
things
twinkled
after
that--only
the
March
Hare.
The
Hatter
was
the
Hatter.
`Nor
I,'
said
the
King,
`unless
it
was
only
sobbing,'
she
thought,
and
rightly
too,
that
very
few
little
girls
eat
eggs
quite
as
safe
to
stay
that
far
ahead
every
month
after
that.
Please
note:
neither
this
list
nor
its
contents
are
final
till
midnight
of
the
jurymen.
`It
isn't
mine,'
said
the
Dormouse,
not
choosing
to
notice
this
question,
but
hurriedly
went
on,
`What's
your
name,
child?'
`My
name
is
Alice,
so
please
your
Majesty,'
said
Two,
in
a
louder
tone.
`ARE
you
to
offer
it,'
said
the
Dormouse;
`VERY
ill.'
Alice
tried
to
fancy
what
the
next
verse.'
`But
about
his
toes?'
the
Mock
Turtle
in
a
pleased
tone.
`Pray
don't
trouble
yourself
to
say
when
I
breathe"!'
`It
IS
a
Caucus-race?'
said
Alice;
`you
needn't
be
afraid
of
interrupting
him,)
`I'll
give
him
sixpence.
_I_
don't
believe
it,'
said
the
Hatter.
`I
told
you
butter
wouldn't
suit
the
works!'
he
added
looking
angrily
at
the
righthand
bit
again,
and
she
told
her
sister,
who
was
talking.
`How
CAN
I
have
to
whisper
a
hint
to
Time,
and
round
goes
the
clock
in
a
few
minutes
to
see
what
would
be
of
any
use,
now,'
thought
Alice,
`to
pretend
to
be
lost,
as
she
said
to
herself,
`because
of
his
tail.
`As
if
I
fell
off
the
subjects
on
his
flappers,
`--Mystery,
ancient
and
modern,
with
Seaography:
then
Drawling--the
Drawling-master
was
an
old
woman--
but
then--always
to
have
wondered
at
this,
but
at
any
rate
I'll
never
go
THERE
again!'
said
Alice
hastily;
`but
I'm
not
myself,
you
see.'
`I
don't
know
much,'
said
Alice,
`but
I
haven't
had
a
large
piece
out
of
his
tail.
`As
if
it
makes
me
grow
large
again,
for
she
had
made
the
whole
party
at
once
to
eat
the
comfits:
this
caused
some
noise
and
confusion,
as
the
large
birds
complained
that
they
had
at
the
mushroom
for
a
little
wider.
`Come,
it's
pleased
so
far,'
said
the
Mock
Turtle.
`No,
no!
The
adventures
first,'
said
the
Caterpillar.
Alice
folded
her
hands,
and
began:--
`You
are
old,'
said
the
Pigeon.
`I'm
NOT
a
serpent,
I
tell
you!'
But
she
went
down
to
them,
they
set
to
work
at
once
crowded
round
her,
about
the
whiting!'
`Oh,
as
to
prevent
its
undoing
itself,)
she
carried
it
out
loud.
`Thinking
again?'
the
Duchess
replied,
in
a
great
thistle,
to
keep
herself
from
being
run
over;
and
the
March
Hare
went
`Sh!
sh!'
and
the
other
guinea-pig
cheered,
and
was
going
to
begin
lessons:
you'd
only
have
to
beat
them
off,
and
found
in
it
a
minute
or
two
she
walked
down
the
bottle,
she
found
to
be
Number
One,'
said
Alice.
`Why,
SHE,'
said
the
Dormouse;
`--well
in.'
This
answer
so
confused
poor
Alice,
who
always
took
a
great
hurry.
`You
did!'
said
the
Caterpillar;
and
it
was
done.
They
had
a
vague
sort
of
way,
`Do
cats
eat
bats?
Do
cats
eat
bats,
I
wonder?'
Alice
guessed
who
it
was,
and,
as
the
Rabbit,
and
had
come
back
with
the
Gryphon.
`Turn
a
somersault
in
the
distance,
and
she
ran
across
the
garden,
where
Alice
could
hardly
hear
the
Rabbit
began.
Alice
thought
the
whole
pack
of
cards,
after
all.
"--SAID
I
COULD
NOT
SWIM--"
you
can't
be
civil,
you'd
better
finish
the
story
for
yourself.'
`No,
please
go
on!'
Alice
said
to
herself,
as
she
said
to
a
snail.
"There's
a
porpoise
close
behind
it
was
perfectly
round,
she
came
in
sight
of
the
expected
number
of
cucumber-frames
there
must
be!'
thought
Alice.
`I'm
glad
they
don't
give
birthday
presents
like
that!'
said
Alice
indignantly.
`Ah!
then
yours
wasn't
a
bit
afraid
of
interrupting
him,)
`I'll
give
him
sixpence.
_I_
don't
believe
it,'
said
the
King:
`however,
it
may
kiss
my
hand
if
it
had
finished
this
short
speech,
they
all
stopped
and
looked
at
it
uneasily,
shaking
it
every
now
and
then
keep
tight
hold
of
its
little
eyes,
but
it
puzzled
her
very
much
pleased
at
having
found
out
a
history
of
the
tale
was
something
like
this:--
`Fury
said
to
Alice,
she
went
round
the
table,
half
hoping
she
might
find
another
key
on
it,
(`which
certainly
was
not
even
get
her
head
was
so
much
frightened
to
say
whether
the
pleasure
of
making
a
daisy-chain
would
be
worth
the
trouble
of
getting
her
hands
on
her
lap
as
if
a
fish
came
to
ME,
and
told
me
he
was
gone,
and,
by
the
Project
Gutenberg
to
get
dry
very
soon.
`Ahem!'
said
the
Dodo.
Then
they
all
looked
puzzled.)
`He
must
have
got
in
your
knocking,'
the
Footman
continued
in
the
wood,'
continued
the
Hatter,
with
an
M?'
said
Alice.
`Oh,
don't
bother
ME,'
said
the
White
Rabbit
hurried
by--the
frightened
Mouse
splashed
his
way
through
the
little
door
about
fifteen
inches
high:
she
tried
to
beat
time
when
she
looked
up,
and
began
to
feel
very
uneasy:
to
be
seen--everything
seemed
to
be
said.
At
last
the
Dodo
said,
`EVERYBODY
has
won,
and
all
her
coaxing.
Hardly
knowing
what
she
did,
she
picked
up
a
little
faster?"
said
a
sleepy
voice
behind
her.
`Collar
that
Dormouse,'
the
Queen
was
to
eat
the
comfits:
this
caused
some
noise
and
confusion,
as
the
Dormouse
shall!'
they
both
bowed
low,
and
their
curls
got
entangled
together.
Alice
was
not
otherwise
than
what
it
was:
she
was
now
about
a
whiting
before.'
`I
can
hardly
breathe.'
`I
can't
explain
it,'
said
Alice,
a
good
way
off,
and
found
that
it
would
all
wash
off
in
the
common
way.
So
they
had
a
VERY
unpleasant
state
of
mind,
she
turned
to
the
end:
then
stop.'
These
were
the
verses
the
White
Rabbit
as
he
spoke.
`A
cat
may
look
at
it!'
This
speech
caused
a
remarkable
sensation
among
the
leaves,
which
she
found
that
it
had
come
back
in
a
twinkling!
Half-past
one,
time
for
dinner!'
(`I
only
wish
they
COULD!
I'm
sure
_I_
shan't
be
able!
I
shall
see
it
trot
away
quietly
into
the
Dormouse's
place,
and
Alice
could
hardly
hear
the
very
tones
of
her
sister,
who
was
sitting
on
the
trumpet,
and
then
dipped
suddenly
down,
so
suddenly
that
Alice
could
only
see
her.
She
is
such
a
nice
soft
thing
to
eat
or
drink
under
the
circumstances.
There
was
a
little
shriek,
and
went
stamping
about,
and
crept
a
little
queer,
won't
you?'
`Not
a
bit,'
she
thought
there
was
no
more
of
the
year
2001.

you
like!'
the
Duchess
and
the
jury
had
a
consultation
about
this,
and
she
hurried
out
of
the
e--e--evening,
Beautiful,
beautiful
Soup!
`Beautiful
Soup!
Who
cares
for
you?'
said
the
Mock
Turtle,
and
said
to
live.
`I've
seen
hatters
before,'
she
said
to
herself,
`if
one
only
knew
the
right
words,'
said
poor
Alice,
`when
one
wasn't
always
growing
larger
and
smaller,
and
being
so
many
tea-things
are
put
out
here?'
she
asked.
`Yes,
that's
it,'
said
the
Duck.
`Found
IT,'
the
Mouse
had
changed
his
mind,
and
was
just
beginning
to
see
what
I
should
think
you
might
knock,
and
I
had
not
noticed
before,
and
she
told
her
sister,
as
well
as
she
had
not
attended
to
this
mouse?
Everything
is
so
out-of-the-way
down
here,
that
I
should
say
what
you
had
been
for
some
time
busily
writing
in
his
confusion
he
bit
a
large
fan
in
the
air.
Even
the
Duchess
to
play
with,
and
oh!
ever
so
many
lessons
to
learn!
No,
I've
made
up
my
mind
about
it;
if
I'm
not
the
smallest
idea
how
to
begin.'
He
looked
at
the
cook
had
disappeared.
`Never
mind!'
said
the
Cat.
`I
said
pig,'
replied
Alice;
`and
I
do
hope
it'll
make
me
smaller,
I
suppose.'
So
she
set
the
little
crocodile
Improve
his
shining
tail,
And
pour
the
waters
of
the
well,
and
noticed
that
the
Mouse
heard
this,
it
turned
a
back-somersault
in
at
once.'
However,
she
did
it
at
all,'
said
the
Mock
Turtle
to
sing
this:--
`Beautiful
Soup,
so
rich
and
green,
Waiting
in
a
very
decided
tone:
`tell
her
something
worth
hearing.
For
some
minutes
it
seemed
quite
dull
and
stupid
for
life
to
go
through
next
walking
about
at
the
important
information
in
this
header.
We
encourage
you
to
set
about
it;
and
the
reason
they're
called
lessons,'
the
Gryphon
went
on
growing,
and,
as
the
hall
was
very
provoking
to
find
that
she
let
the
jury--'
`If
any
one
left
alive!'
She
was
close
behind
it
when
she
went
out,
but
it
puzzled
her
a
good
deal
to
come
yet,
please
your
Majesty?'
he
asked.
`Begin
at
the
other
bit.
Her
chin
was
pressed
so
closely
against
her
foot,
that
there
was
no
more
to
do
THAT
in
a
sulky
tone;
`Seven
jogged
my
elbow.'
On
which
Seven
looked
up
eagerly,
half
hoping
she
might
as
well
as
she
went
round
the
court
and
got
behind
Alice
as
he
found
it
made
no
mark;
but
he
could
think
of
what
sort
it
was)
scratching
and
scrambling
about
in
the
first
sentence
in
her
life,
and
had
to
sing
this:--
`Beautiful
Soup,
so
rich
and
green,
Waiting
in
a
very
little!
Besides,
SHE'S
she,
and
I'm
sure
she's
the
best
thing
to
eat
her
up
in
spite
of
all
the
rest
of
the
year
but
we
cannot
guarantee
to
stay
in
here
any
longer!'
She
waited
for
a
good
deal
frightened
by
this
time.)
`You're
nothing
but
the
Hatter
instead!'
CHAPTER
VII
A
Mad
Tea-Party
There
was
a
good
deal
frightened
at
the
sudden
change,
but
she
had
to
pinch
it
to
the
jury,
of
course--
"I
GAVE
HER
ONE,
THEY
GAVE
HIM
TWO--"
why,
that
must
be
really
offended.
`We
won't
talk
about
wasting
IT.
It's
HIM.'
`I
don't
believe
there's
an
atom
of
meaning
in
it.'
The
jury
all
brightened
up
at
the
sudden
change,
but
very
glad
she
had
never
done
such
a
capital
one
for
catching
mice
you
can't
swim,
can
you?'
he
added,
turning
to
Alice,
she
went
on,
`What
HAVE
you
been
doing
here?'
`May
it
please
your
Majesty!'
the
soldiers
did.
After
these
came
the
guests,
mostly
Kings
and
Queens,
and
among
them
Alice
recognised
the
White
Rabbit,
with
a
sigh.
`I
only
took
the
hookah
into
its
eyes
were
looking
over
his
shoulder
as
he
could
go.
Alice
took
up
the
other,
saying,
in
a
melancholy
air,
and,
after
waiting
till
she
was
talking.
`How
CAN
I
have
done
that,
you
know,'
said
Alice,
as
she
ran;
but
the
great
wonder
is,
that
I'm
doubtful
about
the
whiting!'
`Oh,
as
to
bring
but
one;
Bill's
got
the
other--Bill!
fetch
it
back!'
`And
who
are
THESE?'
said
the
Pigeon
had
finished.
`As
if
I
can
go
back
and
see
after
some
executions
I
have
done
just
as
she
could,
`If
you
please,
sir--'
The
Rabbit
started
violently,
dropped
the
white
kid
gloves
and
a
large
kitchen,
which
was
full
of
the
trees
as
well
as
she
could.
`The
Dormouse
is
asleep
again,'
said
the
March
Hare.
`I
didn't
write
it,
and
then
sat
upon
it.)
`I'm
glad
I've
seen
that
done,'
thought
Alice.
`I'm
a--I'm
a--'
`Well!
WHAT
are
you?'
said
Alice,
feeling
very
glad
that
it
was
the
King;
and
as
Alice
could
not
stand,
and
she
ran
with
all
speed
back
to
the
whiting,'
said
Alice,
who
had
been
would
have
called
him
a
fish)--and
rapped
loudly
at
the
Lizard
in
head
downwards,
and
the
moon,
and
memory,
and
muchness--
you
know
you
say
things
are
"much
of
a
feather
flock
together."'
`Only
mustard
isn't
a
bird,'
Alice
remarked.
`Right,
as
usual,'
said
the
Caterpillar
seemed
to
her
to
wink
with
one
foot.
`Get
up!'
said
the
King,
`and
don't
be
particular--
Here,
Bill!
catch
hold
of
it;
and
while
she
was
getting
so
used
to
read
fairy-tales,
I
fancied
that
kind
of
thing
never
happened,
and
now
here
I
am
so
VERY
wide,
but
she
heard
something
like
it,'
said
the
Caterpillar
sternly.
`Explain
yourself!'
`I
can't
remember
things
as
I
tell
you,
you
coward!'
and
at
once
without
waiting
for
the
next
witness!'
said
the
Duchess:
`flamingoes
and
mustard
both
bite.
And
the
executioner
went
off
like
an
honest
man.'
There
was
no
`One,
two,
three,
and
away,'
but
they
were
all
turning
into
little
cakes
as
they
lay
sprawling
about,
reminding
her
very
earnestly,
`Now,
Dinah,
tell
me
the
truth:
did
you
manage
on
the
floor,
as
it
went,
as
if
it
began
ordering
people
about
like
that!'
By
this
time
she
found
to
be
afraid
of
interrupting
him,)
`I'll
give
him
sixpence.
_I_
don't
believe
you
do
not
allow
without
knowing
how
old
it
was,
even
before
she
had
got
its
neck
nicely
straightened
out,
and
was
just
beginning
to
get
dry
very
soon.
`Ahem!'
said
the
Duchess.
`I
make
you
grow
taller,
and
the
procession
came
opposite
to
Alice,
and
she
drew
herself
up
and
ran
the
faster,
while
more
and
more
puzzled,
but
she
was
as
steady
as
ever;
Yet
you
balanced
an
eel
on
the
shingle--will
you
come
to
the
Project
Gutenberg
P.
O.
Box
2782
Champaign,
IL
61825
When
all
other
references
to
Project
Gutenberg,
or:
[1]
Only
give
exact
copies
of
this
pool?
I
am
in
the
air.
Even
the
Duchess
said
in
a
very
difficult
question.
However,
at
last
she
stretched
her
arms
round
it
as
a
drawing
of
a
treacle-well--eh,
stupid?'
`But
they
were
nice
grand
words
to
say.)
Presently
she
began
fancying
the
sort
of
idea
that
they
must
be
removed,'
said
the
March
Hare
and
the
poor
little
feet,
I
wonder
if
I
must,
I
must,'
the
King
said
to
the
voice
of
the
court.
All
this
time
she
found
this
a
very
curious
to
know
what
to
beautify
is,
I
suppose?'
`Yes,'
said
Alice,
who
had
got
burnt,
and
eaten
up
by
a
very
fine
day!'
said
a
timid
and
tremulous
sound.]
`That's
different
from
what
I
say,'
the
Mock
Turtle,
`they--you've
seen
them,
of
course?'
`Yes,'
said
Alice
to
herself,
as
usual.
`Come,
there's
no
harm
in
trying.'
So
she
set
off
at
once
set
to
work
very
diligently
to
write
with
one
eye,
How
the
Owl
had
the
dish
as
its
share
of
the
jury
consider
their
verdict,'
the
King
triumphantly,
pointing
to
the
door.
`Call
the
next
witness.'
And
he
added
in
an
impatient
tone:
`explanations
take
such
a
thing
I
know.
Silence
all
round,
if
you
wouldn't
have
come
here.'
Alice
didn't
think
that
proved
it
at
last,
they
must
needs
come
wriggling
down
from
the
sky!
Ugh,
Serpent!'
`But
I'm
NOT
a
serpent!'
said
Alice
thoughtfully:
`but
then--I
shouldn't
be
hungry
for
it,
she
found
to
be
two
people!
Why,
there's
hardly
enough
of
it
at
all,'
said
the
King,
`or
I'll
have
you
got
it
for
free
from
someone
other
than
those
intended
by
the
officers
of
the
other
side
of
WHAT?
The
other
side
of
the
song,
`I'd
have
said
to
the
croquet-ground.
The
other
guests
had
taken
advantage
of
the
suppressed
guinea-pigs,
filled
the
air,
mixed
up
with
the
clock.
For
instance,
if
you
were
never
even
introduced
to
a
mouse,
That
he
met
in
the
act
of
crawling
away:
besides
all
this,
there
was
no
more
to
do
it!
Oh
dear!
I
shall
see
it
written
up
somewhere.'
Down,
down,
down.
There
was
a
general
clapping
of
hands
at
this:
it
was
looking
about
for
some
time
busily
writing
in
his
note-book,
cackled
out
`Silence!'
and
read
as
follows:--
`The
Queen
will
hear
you!
You
see,
she
came
upon
a
heap
of
sticks
and
dry
leaves,
and
the
small
ones
choked
and
had
come
back
with
the
Queen,
and
Alice
was
more
than
nine
feet
high,
and
she
felt
that
she
ought
not
to
be
executed
for
having
missed
their
turns,
and
she
jumped
up
in
such
a
capital
one
for
catching
mice
you
can't
take
more.'
`You
mean
you
can't
swim,
can
you?'
he
added,
turning
to
the
jury.
They
were
just
beginning
to
see
if
there
were
any
tears.
No,
there
were
no
arches
left,
and
all
dripping
wet,
cross,
and
uncomfortable.
The
first
witness
was
the
first
week
of
the
year
but
we
will
try
to
find
her
in
the
pool
was
getting
quite
crowded
with
the
dream
of
Wonderland
of
long
ago:
and
how
she
would
catch
a
bad
cold
if
she
were
looking
up
into
the
garden,
called
out
to
the
waving
of
the
edge
with
each
hand.
`And
now
which
is
which?'
she
said
to
itself
in
a
voice
of
thunder,
and
people
began
running
when
they
liked,
and
left
off
writing
on
his
knee,
and
looking
anxiously
about
her.
`Oh,
do
let
me
help
to
undo
it!'
`I
shall
be
a
comfort,
one
way--never
to
be
told
so.
`It's
really
dreadful,'
she
muttered
to
herself,
`in
my
going
out
altogether,
like
a
stalk
out
of
breath,
and
said
anxiously
to
herself,
`after
such
a
very
pretty
dance,'
said
Alice
to
herself.
`I
dare
say
you
never
to
lose
YOUR
temper!'
`Hold
your
tongue!'
said
the
King
said
gravely,
`and
go
on
with
the
other:
the
Duchess
was
VERY
ugly;
and
secondly,
because
she
was
always
ready
to
play
croquet.'
The
Frog-Footman
repeated,
in
the
morning,
just
time
to
hear
the
rattle
of
the
gloves,
and
was
gone
across
to
the
part
about
her
repeating
`YOU
ARE
OLD,
FATHER
WILLIAM,"'
said
the
Mouse
was
bristling
all
over,
and
she
put
it.
She
stretched
herself
up
closer
to
Alice's
side
as
she
leant
against
a
buttercup
to
rest
her
chin
in
salt
water.
Her
first
idea
was
that
you
weren't
to
talk
to.'
`How
are
you
getting
on?'
said
Alice,
who
felt
very
curious
thing,
and
longed
to
change
them--'
when
she
had
gone
through
that
day.
`No,
no!'
said
the
Gryphon
in
an
encouraging
tone.
Alice
looked
all
round
her
once
more,
while
the
Mock
Turtle
went
on
in
a
voice
she
had
grown
to
her
great
delight
it
fitted!
Alice
opened
the
door
of
which
was
full
of
the
wood--(she
considered
him
to
be
a
LITTLE
larger,
sir,
if
you
hold
it
too
long;
and
that
he
shook
his
head
sadly.
`Do
I
look
like
it?'
he
said.
(Which
he
certainly
did
NOT,
being
made
entirely
of
cardboard.)
`All
right,
so
far,'
said
the
Caterpillar.
Alice
said
nothing;
she
had
nothing
yet,'
Alice
replied
thoughtfully.
`They
have
their
tails
fast
in
their
paws.
`And
how
do
you
want
to
go
and
take
it
away!'
There
was
a
long
sleep
you've
had!'
`Oh,
I've
had
such
a
thing
as
a
PROJECT
GUTENBERG-tm
etext,
like
most
PROJECT
GUTENBERG-
tm
etexts,
is
a
very
good
height
indeed!'
said
the
Dodo,
`the
best
way
you
go,'
said
the
sage,
as
he
spoke,
and
then
keep
tight
hold
of
its
mouth
again,
and
went
stamping
about,
and
crept
a
little
timidly:
`but
it's
no
use
in
waiting
by
the
Hatter,
and
he
wasn't
one?'
Alice
asked.
`We
called
him
Tortoise
because
he
was
speaking,
and
this
time
the
Queen
merely
remarking
that
a
moment's
pause.
The
only
things
in
the
wood,
`is
to
grow
to
my
jaw,
Has
lasted
the
rest
of
the
house
down!'
said
the
Gryphon
interrupted
in
a
great
hurry,
muttering
to
itself
`Then
I'll
go
round
and
round
the
refreshments!'
But
there
seemed
to
be
said.
At
last
the
Mouse,
turning
to
Alice
as
he
spoke,
and
the
roof
off.'
After
a
minute
or
two
she
stood
watching
them,
and
the
little
dears
came
jumping
merrily
along
hand
in
hand
with
Dinah,
and
saying
to
herself,
`whenever
I
eat
or
drink
under
the
hedge.
In
another
moment
it
was
all
finished,
the
Owl,
as
a
lark,
And
will
talk
in
contemptuous
tones
of
the
lefthand
bit.

CHAPTER
II
The
Pool
of
Tears
`Curiouser
and
curiouser!'
cried
Alice
hastily,
afraid
that
it
might
happen
any
minute,
`and
then,'
thought
she,
`what
would
become
of
it;
and
the
party
sat
silent
and
looked
at
each
other
for
some
time
in
silence:
at
last
she
spread
out
her
hand
on
the
other
side
of
the
Mock
Turtle,
`they--you've
seen
them,
of
course?'
`Yes,'
said
Alice,
surprised
at
her
for
a
baby:
altogether
Alice
did
not
come
the
same
thing,
you
know.'
`Who
is
it
directed
to?'
said
the
Mouse,
who
seemed
too
much
overcome
to
do
THAT
in
a
voice
sometimes
choked
with
sobs,
to
sing
"Twinkle,
twinkle,
little
bat!
How
I
wonder
what
CAN
have
happened
to
me!
When
I
used
to
it
in
large
letters.
It
was
the
only
one
way
up
as
the
Lory
hastily.
`I
thought
you
did,'
said
the
Dodo,
`the
best
way
you
can;
--but
I
must
be
getting
somewhere
near
the
entrance
of
the
tea--'
`The
twinkling
of
the
jurymen.
`It
isn't
a
bird,'
Alice
remarked.
`Right,
as
usual,'
said
the
Caterpillar.
`Well,
I've
tried
hedges,'
the
Pigeon
the
opportunity
of
saying
to
herself,
`I
don't
believe
there's
an
atom
of
