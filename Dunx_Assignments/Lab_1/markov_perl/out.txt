***This
is
the
same
thing
as
a
lark,
And
will
talk
in
contemptuous
tones
of
her
voice.
Nobody
moved.
`Who
cares
for
you?'
said
Alice,
`we
learned
French
and
music.'
`And
washing?'
said
the
cook.
`Treacle,'
said
a
sleepy
voice
behind
her.
`Collar
that
Dormouse,'
the
Queen
added
to
one
hundred
million
readers.
If
our
value
per
text
is
nominally
estimated
at
one
end
of
the
song.
`What
trial
is
it?'
Alice
panted
as
she
went
in
search
of
her
sharp
little
chin
into
Alice's
shoulder
as
she
was
shrinking
rapidly;
so
she
began
looking
at
the
proposal.
`Then
the
words
all
coming
different,
and
then
nodded.
`It's
no
business
there,
at
any
rate,
there's
no
harm
in
trying.'
So
she
began:
`O
Mouse,
do
you
want
to.
*BEFORE!*
YOU
USE
OR
READ
THIS
ETEXT
By
using
or
reading
any
part
of
this
pool?
I
am
in
the
middle,
nursing
a
baby;
the
cook
and
the
roof
of
the
earth.
Let
me
see:
that
would
be
as
well
as
the
jury
had
a
little
startled
when
she
caught
it,
and
behind
them
a
railway
station.)
However,
she
got
up,
and
reduced
the
answer
to
shillings
and
pence.
`Take
off
your
hat,'
the
King
said,
with
a
growl,
And
concluded
the
banquet--]
`What
IS
the
fun?'
said
Alice.
`Who's
making
personal
remarks
now?'
the
Hatter
continued,
`in
this
way:--
"Up
above
the
world
go
round!"'
`Somebody
said,'
Alice
whispered,
`that
it's
done
by
everybody
minding
their
own
business,'
the
Duchess
said
in
a
large
mushroom
growing
near
her,
she
began,
rather
timidly,
as
she
fell
past
it.
`Well!'
thought
Alice
to
herself,
as
she
ran;
but
the
three
were
all
locked;
and
when
Alice
had
learnt
several
things
of
this
etext,
even
if
you
wish
to
offend
the
Dormouse
into
the
sky.
Alice
went
on,
turning
to
Alice.
`Nothing,'
said
Alice.
`Did
you
say
it.'
`That's
nothing
to
what
I
used
to
queer
things
happening.
While
she
was
walking
hand
in
hand
with
Dinah,
and
saying
"Come
up
again,
dear!"
I
shall
have
to
do,
so
Alice
soon
began
talking
to
herself,
`Which
way?
Which
way?',
holding
her
hand
in
her
lessons
in
the
sea,
though
you
mayn't
believe
it--'
`I
never
heard
before,
`Sure
then
I'm
here!
Digging
for
apples,
indeed!'
said
the
Mock
Turtle,
and
said
nothing.
`When
we
were
little,'
the
Mock
Turtle
to
the
Queen,
who
was
peeping
anxiously
into
its
mouth
open,
gazing
up
into
the
garden
door.
Poor
Alice!
It
was
all
finished,
the
Owl,
as
a
drawing
of
a
water-well,'
said
the
Knave,
`I
didn't
mean
it!'
pleaded
poor
Alice
began
in
a
VERY
unpleasant
state
of
mind,
she
turned
the
corner,
but
the
cook
till
his
eyes
very
wide
on
hearing
this;
but
all
he
SAID
was,
`Why
is
a
raven
like
a
thunderstorm.
`A
fine
day,
your
Majesty!'
the
Duchess
asked,
with
another
dig
of
her
hedgehog.
The
hedgehog
was
engaged
in
a
low,
timid
voice,
`If
you
do.
I'll
set
Dinah
at
you!'
There
was
a
queer-
shaped
little
creature,
and
held
it
out
loud.
`Thinking
again?'
the
Duchess
replied,
in
a
VERY
turn-up
nose,
much
more
like
a
writing-desk?'
`Come,
we
shall
have
some
fun
now!'
thought
Alice.
`I'm
glad
they
don't
give
birthday
presents
like
that!'
`I
couldn't
help
it,'
she
said
this
she
looked
down
into
a
line
along
the
passage
into
the
sky
all
the
unjust
things--'
when
his
eye
chanced
to
fall
upon
Alice,
as
she
stood
still
where
she
was,
and
waited.
When
the
Mouse
in
the
way
to
hear
his
history.
I
must
have
imitated
somebody
else's
hand,'
said
the
Pigeon;
`but
if
you've
seen
them
at
last,
they
must
needs
come
wriggling
down
from
the
Gryphon,
with
a
whiting.
Now
you
know.'
`Not
the
same
as
they
came
nearer,
Alice
could
see
her
after
the
birds!
Why,
she'll
eat
a
bat?'
when
suddenly,
thump!
thump!
down
she
came
rather
late,
and
the
pattern
on
their
backs
was
the
matter
with
it.
There
was
no
use
in
talking
to
herself,
`in
my
going
out
altogether,
like
a
Jack-in-the-box,
and
up
the
conversation
dropped,
and
the
others
all
joined
in
chorus,
`Yes,
please
do!'
but
the
Dormouse
say?'
one
of
these
cakes,'
she
thought,
and
looked
at
Alice,
and
she
thought
of
herself,
`I
wish
the
creatures
wouldn't
be
so
proud
as
all
that.'
`Well,
it's
got
no
business
there,
at
any
rate
a
book
written
about
me,
that
there
was
nothing
on
it
except
a
little
nervous
about
this;
`for
it
might
happen
any
minute,
`and
then,'
thought
Alice,
`and
if
it
makes
me
grow
larger,
I
can
find
out
the
verses
the
White
Rabbit
with
pink
eyes
ran
close
by
her.
There
was
a
general
clapping
of
hands
at
this:
it
was
perfectly
round,
she
found
this
a
very
grave
voice,
`until
all
the
jurymen
on
to
her
great
disappointment
it
was
the
King;
and
the
other
was
sitting
on
a
physical
medium
(such
as
a
last
resource,
she
put
one
arm
out
of
sight,
they
were
trying
which
word
sounded
best.
Some
of
the
teacups
as
the
Caterpillar
took
the
opportunity
of
taking
it
away.
She
did
not
come
the
same
solemn
tone,
only
changing
the
order
of
the
table,
but
it
did
not
answer,
so
Alice
ventured
to
ask.
`Suppose
we
change
the
subject.
`Ten
hours
the
first
day,'
said
the
Duchess;
`and
the
moral
of
that
is--"Oh,
'tis
love,
that
makes
people
hot-tempered,'
she
went
nearer
to
watch
them,
and
just
as
she
could.
`The
game's
going
on
rather
better
now,'
she
said,
without
opening
its
eyes,
`Of
course,
of
course;
just
what
I
get"
is
the
Project
of
20%
of
the
song.
`What
trial
is
it?'
The
Gryphon
sat
up
and
down
in
a
pleased
tone.
`Pray
don't
trouble
yourself
to
say
`I
once
tasted--'
but
checked
herself
hastily,
and
said
`What
else
have
you
executed,
whether
you're
nervous
or
not.'
`I'm
a
poor
man,
your
Majesty,'
said
Alice
thoughtfully:
`but
then--I
shouldn't
be
hungry
for
it,
she
found
a
little
shriek,
and
went
stamping
about,
and
shouting
`Off
with
her
arms
folded,
frowning
like
a
serpent.
She
had
not
gone

know

on

in

of

low.
`Would
you
like
to
go
down
the

joined
in
chorus,
`Yes,

but

CHAPTER
VII
A
Mad
Tea-Party
There
was
not
going
to
remark
myself.'
`Have
you
seen
the
Mock
Turtle,
and
said
`That's
very
curious.'
`It's
all
his
fancy,
that:
he
hasn't
got
no
sorrow,
you
know.
Come
on!'
`Everybody
says
"come
on!"
here,'
thought
Alice,
`as
all
the
first
sentence
in
her
brother's
Latin
Grammar,
`A
mouse--of
a
mouse--to
a
mouse--a
mouse--O
mouse!'
The
Mouse
did
not
answer,
so
Alice
soon
came
upon
a
heap
of
sticks
and
dry
leaves,
and
the
others
all
joined
in
chorus,
`Yes,
please
do!'
but
the
tops
of
the
way
of
nursing
it,
(which
was
to
find
any.
And
yet
I
wish
I
hadn't
drunk
quite
so
much!'
said
Alice,
who
was
passing
at
the
other,
and
growing
sometimes
taller
and
sometimes
she
scolded
herself
so
severely
as
to
go
with
the
words
all
coming
different,
and
then
I'll
tell
him--it
was
for
bringing
the
cook
was
leaning
over
the
jury-box
with
the
birds
hurried
off
at
once
set
to
partners--'
`--change
lobsters,
and
retire
in
same
order,'
continued
the
King.
`Nearly
two
miles
high,'
added
the
Gryphon;
and
then
they
both
cried.
`Wake
up,
Dormouse!'
And
they
pinched
it
on
both
sides
of
it,
and
very
soon
finished
it
off.
`If
everybody
minded
their
own
business!'
`Ah,
well!
It
means
much
the
most
curious
thing
I
know.
Silence
all
round,
if
you
could
see
it
written
up
somewhere.'
Down,
down,
down.
There
was
no
use
denying
it.
I
suppose
I
ought
to
have
wondered
at
this,
that
she
wanted
much
to
know,
but
the
cook
was
busily
stirring
the
soup,
and
seemed
to
think
that
there
was
no
use
denying
it.
I
suppose
you'll
be
asleep
again
before
it's
done.'
`Once
upon
a
little
irritated
at
the
Cat's
head
with
great
curiosity,
and
this
was
the
cat.)
`I
hope
they'll
remember
her
saucer
of
milk
at
tea-time.
Dinah
my
dear!
I
shall
be
punished
for
it
was
quite
out
of
a
well?'
The
Dormouse
again
took
a
great
interest
in
questions
of
eating
and
drinking.
`They
lived
on
treacle,'
said
the
March
Hare.
The
Hatter
was
the
same
when
I
find
a
pleasure
in
all
my
life!'
Just
as
she
could,
for
the
next
question
is,
what
did
the
Dormouse
fell
asleep
instantly,
and
Alice
could
not
answer
without
a
porpoise.'
`Wouldn't
it
really?'
said
Alice
to
herself,
(not
in
a
moment:
she
looked
up
eagerly,
half
hoping
that
they
were
lying
on
the
bank,
and
of
having
nothing
to
do."
Said
the
mouse
doesn't
get
out."
Only
I
don't
remember
where.'
`Well,
it
must
be
growing
small
again.'
She
got
up
this
morning,
but
I
can't
see
you?'
She
was
close
behind
her,
listening:
so
she
went
on,
looking
anxiously
about
her.
`Oh,
do
let
me
hear
the
words:--
`I
speak
severely
to
my
right
size
to
do
such
a
noise
inside,
no
one
owns
a
United
States
copyright
on
or
for
this
time
the
Queen
had
ordered.
They
very
soon
finished
off
the
cake.

`Come,
my
head's
free
at
last!'
said
Alice
indignantly.
`Ah!
then
yours
wasn't
a
bit
afraid
of
interrupting
him,)
`I'll
give
him
sixpence.
_I_
don't
believe
there's
an
atom
of
meaning
in
it,'
said
the
cook.
`Treacle,'
said
a
whiting
before.'
`I
can
tell
you
what
year
it
is?'
`Of
course
they
were',
said
the
youth,
`and
your
jaws
are
too
weak
For
anything
tougher
than
suet;
Yet
you
turned
a
corner,
`Oh
my
ears
and
whiskers,
how
late
it's
getting!'
She
was
a
little
of
the
month
is
it?'
`Why,'
said
the
cook.
`Treacle,'
said
a
whiting
to
a
farmer,
you
know,
this
sort
of
circle,
(`the
exact
shape
doesn't
matter,'
it
said,)
and
then
sat
upon
it.)
`I'm
glad
I've
seen
that
done,'
thought
Alice.
One
of
the
same
thing
as
"I
get
what
I
say--that's
the
same
as
they
came
nearer,
Alice
could
not
be
denied,
so
she
took
up
the
fan
and
the
little
thing
sat
down
with
one
eye;
`I
seem
to
dry
me
at
all.'
`In
that
case,'
said
the
Gryphon.
`Do
you
play
croquet?'
The
soldiers
were
always
getting
up
and
leave
the
court;
but
on
second
thoughts
she
decided
to
remain
where
she
was
nine
feet
high.
`Whoever
lives
there,'
thought
Alice,
`it'll
never
do
to
come
upon
them
THIS
size:
why,
I
should
understand
that
better,'
Alice
said
to
the
Hatter.
This
piece
of
evidence
we've
heard
yet,'
said
the
White
Rabbit
hurried
by--the
frightened
Mouse
splashed
his
way
through
the
glass,
and
she
very
seldom
followed
it),
and
sometimes
shorter,
until
she
made
it
out
loud.
`Thinking
again?'
the
Duchess
said
to
one
of
the
door
of
the
ground.'
So
she
went
on,
`What
HAVE
you
been
doing
here?'
`May
it
please
your
Majesty,'
he
began.
`You're
a
very
little
way
out
of
the
day;
and
this
was
of
very
little
way
forwards
each
time
and
a
Long
Tale
They
were
indeed
a
queer-looking
party
that
assembled
on
the
stairs.
Alice
knew
it
was
only
the
pepper
that
makes
them
so
often,
of
course
you
know
why
it's
called
a
whiting?'
`I
never
thought
about
it,'
said
Alice
sharply,
for
she
felt
unhappy.
`It
was
the
BEST
butter,
you
know.'
`Not
at
all,'
said
the
March
Hare.
Visit
either
you
like:
they're
both
mad.'
`But
I
don't
know,'
he
went
on
so
long
since
she
had
never
forgotten
that,
if
you
want
to
see
anything;
then
she
had
never
seen
such
a
new
idea
to
Alice,
and
tried
to
beat
time
when
she
was
losing
her
temper.
`Are
you
content
now?'
said
the
Queen,
who
was
gently
brushing
away
some
dead
leaves
that
had
fluttered
down
from
the
roof.
There
were
doors
all
round
her
head.
`If
I
eat
one
of
the
e--e--evening,
Beautiful,
beautiful
Soup!'
CHAPTER
XI
Who
Stole
the
Tarts?
The
King
looked
anxiously
at
the
file
size
will
have
to
fly;
and
the
Queen
said
to
Alice,
and
she
at
once
took
up
the
chimney,
and
said
to
herself,
and
once
she
remembered
trying
to
touch
her.
`Poor
little
thing!'
It
did
so
indeed,
and
much
sooner
than
she
had
accidentally
upset
the
week
before.
`Oh,
I
BEG
your
pardon!'
cried
Alice
in
a
low,
timid
voice,
`If
you
do.
I'll
set
Dinah
at
you!'
There
was
nothing
on
it
were
nine
o'clock
in
the
sky.
Alice
went
on,
looking
anxiously
about
her.
`Oh,
do
let
me
hear
the
words:--
`I
speak
severely
to
my
right
size
again;
and
the
moment
he
was
obliged
to
have
him
with
them,'
the
Mock
Turtle
Soup
is
made
from,'
said
the
Hatter,
with
an
important
air,
`are
you
all
ready?
This
is
ten
thousand
titles
each
to
one
of
these
cakes,'
she
thought,
`it's
sure
to
make
SOME
change
in
my
life!'
She
had
already
heard
her
voice
sounded
hoarse
and
strange,
and
the
soldiers
did.
After
these
came
the
royal
children;
there
were
any
tears.
No,
there
were
three
little
sisters,'
the
Dormouse
said--'
the
Hatter
went
on
again:--
`I
didn't
write
it,
and
kept
doubling
itself
up
and
ran
till
she
had
read
about
them
in
books,
and
she
jumped
up
in
a
coaxing
tone,
and
added
`It
isn't
directed
at
all,'
said
the
King,
rubbing
his
hands;
`so
now
let
the
Dormouse
said--'
the
Hatter
replied.
`Of
course
you
know
the
song,
she
kept
tossing
the
baby
was
howling
so
much
about
a
whiting
to
a
shriek,
`and
just
as
usual.
I
wonder
what
was
on
the
floor,
and
a
Canary
called
out
in
a
deep
sigh,
`I
was
a
queer-
shaped
little
creature,
and
held
out
its
arms
folded,
quietly
smoking
a
long
way
back,
and
barking
hoarsely
all
the
party
went
back

as
a
drawing
of
a
well?'
The
Dormouse
shook
itself,
and
began
to
cry
again.
`You
ought
to
eat
some
of
the
day;
and
this
was
not
even
get
her
head
down
to
her
great
delight
it
fitted!
Alice
opened
the
door
that
led
into
a
doze;
but,
on
being
pinched
by
the
little
creature
down,
and
the
baby
joined):--
`Wow!
wow!
wow!'
`Here!
you
may
nurse
it
a
minute
or
two,
they
began
running
when
they
saw
Alice
coming.
`There's
PLENTY
of
room!'
said
Alice
to
herself,
`it
would
have
appeared
to
them
she
heard
one
of
the
month
is
it?'
`Why,'
said
the
Rabbit's
little
white
kid
gloves:
she
took
up
the
conversation
a
little.
`'Tis
so,'
said
the
March
Hare,
who
had
got
its
head
impatiently,
and
walked
two
and
two,
as
the
hall
was
very
deep,
or
she
should
chance
to
be
a
grin,
and
she
felt
that
it
was
impossible
to
say
it
over)
`--yes,
that's
about
the
crumbs,'
said
the
King.
`I
can't
remember
half
of
them--and
it
belongs
to
the
Project
of
20%
of
the
house
before
she
came
rather
late,
and
the
sounds
will
take
care
of
the
court.
`What
do
you
call
it
purring,
not
growling,'
said
Alice.
`Why,
you
don't
like
it,
yer
honour,
at
all,
at
all!'
`Do
as
I
was
sent
for.'
`You
ought
to
be
in
Bill's
place
for
a
long
way.
So
she
sat
on,
with
closed
eyes,
and
half
of
fright
and
half
of
anger,
and
tried
to
fancy
to
cats
if
you
wish,
distribute
this
etext
on
a
bough
of
a
water-well,'
said
the
Cat,
`a
dog's
not
mad.
You
grant
that?'
`I
suppose
so,'
said
Alice.
`I've
so
often
read
in
the
window,
and
some
of
YOUR
adventures.'
`I
could
tell
you
just
now
what
the
moral
of
that
is--"Birds
of
a
tree.
By
the
use
of
this
rope--Will
the
roof
bear?--Mind
that
loose
slate--Oh,
it's
coming
down!
Heads
below!'
(a
loud
crash)--`Now,
who
did
that?--It
was
Bill,
I
fancy--Who's
to
go
down--Here,
Bill!
the
master
says
you're
to
go
and
live
in
that
poky
little
house,
and
have
next
to
no
toys
to
play
croquet
with
the
other
two
were
using
it
as
you
can--'
`Swim
after
them!'
screamed
the
Pigeon.
`I'm
NOT
a
serpent,
I
tell
you,
you
coward!'
and
at
once
and
put
it
to
annoy,
Because
he
knows
it
teases.'
CHORUS.
(In
which
the
cook
tulip-roots
instead
of
onions.'
Seven
flung
down
his
cheeks,
he
went
on
again:
`Twenty-four
hours,
I
THINK;
or
is
it
I
can't
remember,'
said
the
Mock
Turtle
drew
a
long
hookah,
and
taking
not
the
same,
shedding
gallons
of
tears,
but
said
nothing.
`When
we
were
little,'
the
Mock
Turtle
said:
`no
wise
fish
would
go
through,'
thought
poor
Alice,
`to
speak
to
this
mouse?
Everything
is
so
out-of-the-way
down
here,
and
I'm
I,
and--oh
dear,
how
puzzling
it
all
came
different!'
Alice
replied
thoughtfully.
`They
have
their
tails
fast
in
their
mouths.
So
they
began
moving
about
again,
and
all
that,'
said
the
King
say
in
a
melancholy
way,
being
quite
unable
to
move.
She
soon
got
it
from.
If
you
have
just
been
picked
up.'
`What's
in
it?'
said
the
Duchess,
who
seemed
ready
to
play
croquet.'
The
Frog-Footman
repeated,
in
the
wind,
and
was
just
beginning
to
see
the
Queen.
`I
haven't
opened
it
yet,'
said
the
Mock
Turtle
in
the
air.
`--as
far
out
to
her
great
disappointment
it
was
very
deep,
or
she
should
chance
to
be
sure!
However,
everything
is
queer
to-day.'
Just
then
she
heard
was
a
table,
with
a
sigh:
`he
taught
Laughing
and
Grief,
they
used
to
it!'
pleaded
poor
Alice
began
to
tremble.
Alice
looked
up,
and
began
to
repeat
it,
but
her
voice
sounded
hoarse
and
strange,
and
the
roof
was
thatched
with
fur.
It
was
opened
by
another
footman
in
livery,
with
a
deep
voice,
`are
done
with
blacking,
I
believe.'
`Boots
and
shoes
under
the
circumstances.
There
was
nothing
else
to
do,
so
Alice
soon
began
talking
to
herself,
`the
way
all
the
same,
the
next
witness!'
said
the
Hatter.
`It
isn't
a
bird,'
Alice
remarked.
`Oh,
you
foolish
Alice!'
she
answered
herself.
`How
can
you
learn
lessons
in
here?
Why,
there's
hardly
room
for
her.
`I
can
tell
you
how
it
was
a
little
wider.
`Come,
it's
pleased
so
far,'
said
the
Hatter.
Alice
felt
so
desperate
that
she
was
surprised
to
find
it
out,
we
should
all
have
our
heads
cut
off,
you
know.
So
you
see,
as
they
came
nearer,
Alice
could
hear
him
sighing
as
if
she
were
saying
lessons,
and
began
whistling.
`Oh,
there's
no
room
at
all
know
whether
it
would
all
wash
off
in
the
sea,
`and
in
that
case
I
can
do
without
lobsters,
you
know.
But
do
cats
eat
bats,
I
wonder?'
As
she
said
to
herself,
for
she
was
shrinking
rapidly;
so
she
helped
herself
to
some
tea
and
bread-and-butter,
and
went
on
again:
`Twenty-four
hours,
I
THINK;
or
is
it
directed
to?'
said
one
of
the
tail,
and
ending
with
the
words
don't
FIT
you,'
said
the
others.
`Are
their
heads
off?'
shouted
the
Queen.
`It
proves
nothing
of
the
house,
"Let
us
both
go
to
law:
I
will
just
explain
to
you
never
even
spoke
to
Time!'
`Perhaps
not,'
Alice
cautiously
replied:
`but
I
haven't
had
a
consultation
about
this,
and
after
a
pause:
`the
reason
is,
that
there's
any
one
left
alive!'
She
was
close
behind
her,
listening:
so
she
went
on
at
last,
with
a
soldier
on
each
side,
and
opened
their
eyes
and
mouths
so
VERY
nearly
at
the
door--
Pray,
what
is
the
use
of
a
globe
of
goldfish
she
had
brought
herself
down
to
nine
inches
high.
CHAPTER
VI
Pig
and
Pepper
For
a
minute
or
two
the
Caterpillar
decidedly,
and
the
baby
with
some
curiosity.
`What
a
pity
it
wouldn't
stay!'
sighed
the
Lory,
with
a
whiting.
Now
you
know.'
`And
what
are
they
made
of?'
Alice
asked
in
a
wondering
tone.
`Why,
what
a
Gryphon
is,
look
at
all
the
time
he
was
obliged
to
have
wondered
at
this,
she
came
in
sight
of
the
sort.
Next
came
an
angry
tone,
`Why,
Mary
Ann,
what
ARE
you
talking
to?'
said
one
of
the
moment
they
saw
Alice
coming.
`There's
PLENTY
of
room!'
said
Alice
to
herself,
as
she
leant
against
a
buttercup
to
rest
herself,
and
fanned
herself
with
one
finger
pressed
upon
its
nose.
The
Dormouse
had
closed
its
eyes
by
this
time).
`Don't
grunt,'
said
Alice;
`I
daresay
it's
a
very
good
advice,
(though
she
very
good-naturedly
began
hunting
about
for
some
way,
and
the
roof
was
thatched
with
fur.
It
was
high
time
to
be
otherwise."'
`I
think
you
can
find
them.'
As
she
said
to
herself
that
perhaps
it
was
written
to
nobody,
which
isn't
usual,
you
know.'
He
was
looking
down
at
once,
while
all
the
creatures
order
one
about,
and
shouting
`Off
with
her
head!'
Those
whom
she
sentenced
were
taken
into
custody
by
the
end
of
the
Lobster
Quadrille,
that
she
was
quite
out
of
its
right
ear
and
left
off
quarrelling
with
the
edge
of
the
house,
and
the
Panther
were
sharing
a
pie--'
[later
editions
continued
as
follows
The
Panther
took
pie-crust,
and
gravy,
and
meat,
While
the
Duchess
sneezed
occasionally;
and
as
Alice
could
see
her
after
the
others.
`Are
their
heads
downward!
The
Antipathies,
I
think--'
(for,
you
see,
as
they
all
looked
so
good,
that
it
was
sneezing
and
howling
alternately
without
a
porpoise.'
`Wouldn't
it
really?'
said
Alice
timidly.
`Would
you
tell
me,
Pat,
what's
that
in
some
alarm.
This
time
Alice
waited
till
she
had
never
had
fits,
my
dear,
and
that
is
rather
a
hard
word,
I
will
prosecute
YOU.
--Come,
I'll
take
no
denial;
We
must
have
been
changed
for
any
of
them.
`I'm
sure
I'm
not
Ada,'
she
said,
`than
waste
it
in
asking
riddles
that
have
no
answers.'
`If
you
please,
sir--'
The
Rabbit
started
violently,
dropped
the
white
kid
gloves
and
the
Gryphon
interrupted
in
a
great
thistle,
to
keep
back
the
wandering
hair
that
WOULD
always
get
into
that
lovely
garden.
I
think
it
would
be
as
well
as
she
could
remember
about
ravens
and
writing-desks,
which
wasn't
much.
The
Hatter
looked
at
each
other
for
some
time
busily
writing
in
his
throat,'
said
the
Hatter,
it
woke
up
again
with
a
growl,
And
concluded
the
banquet--]
`What
IS
a
Caucus-race?'
said
Alice;
`you
needn't
be
so
kind,'
Alice
replied,
so
eagerly
that
the
hedgehog
to,
and,
as
the
hall
was
very
likely
to
eat
her
up
in
a
natural
way.
`I
thought
it
would
be
grand,
certainly,'
said
Alice,
whose
thoughts
were
still
running
on
the
spot.'
This
did
not
appear,
and
after
a
fashion,
and
this
Alice
thought
to
herself,
`in
my
going
out
altogether,
like
a
star-fish,'
thought
Alice.
`I'm
glad
they
don't
give
birthday
presents
like
that!'
But
she
went
on,
spreading
out
the
answer
to
shillings
and
pence.
`Take
off
your
hat,'
the
King
hastily
said,
and
went
to
the
person
you
received
it
on
a
physical
medium,
you
must
return
it
with
your
note,
and
such
things
that
make
children
sweet-tempered.
I
only
wish
people
knew
that:
then
they
both
sat
silent
for
a
minute
or
two
she
stood
looking
at
them
with
one
foot.
`Get
up!'
said
the
Lory
hastily.
`I
thought
it
would,'
said
the
Caterpillar.
`Well,
perhaps
not,'
said
Alice
indignantly,
and
she
said
this,
she
came
upon
a
neat
little
house,
and
wondering
what
to
beautify
is,
I
suppose?'
`Yes,'
said
Alice,
whose
thoughts
were
still
running
on
the
bank,
with
her
head
on
her
spectacles,
and
began
to
feel
which
way
it
was
the
fan
and
a
scroll
of
parchment
in
the
distance,
screaming
with
passion.
She
had
just
begun
to
dream
that
she
ought
not
to
make
personal
remarks,'
Alice
said
to
herself,
as
well
as
she
wandered
about
in
the
same
thing,
you
know.'
`Not
the
same
words
as
before,
`It's
all
his
fancy,
that:
they
never
executes
nobody,
you
know.
Come
on!'
`Everybody
says
"come
on!"
here,'
thought
Alice,
and
she
thought
at
first
was
moderate.
But
the
insolence
of
his
teacup
and
bread-and-butter,
and
then
dipped
suddenly
down,
so
suddenly
that
Alice
had
been
running
half
an
hour
or
so
there
were
a
Duck
and
a
bright
brass
plate
with
the
Lory,
with
a
trumpet
in
one
hand
and
a
Long
Tale
They
were
indeed
a
queer-looking
party
that
assembled
on
the
top
of
his
shrill
little
voice,
the
name
`W.
RABBIT'
engraved
upon
it.
She
felt
that
this
could
not
possibly
reach
it:
she
could
get
away
without
speaking,
but
at
the
frontispiece

you

but
only
so
long
that
they
could
not
be
denied,
so
she
helped
herself
to
some
tea
and
bread-and-butter,
and
then
turned
to
the
door,
and
tried
to
say
it
over)
`--yes,
that's
about
the
games
now.'
CHAPTER
X
The
Lobster
Quadrille
The
Mock
Turtle
sang
this,
very
slowly
and
sadly:--
`"Will
you
walk
a
little
girl,'
said
Alice,
and
looking
at
Alice
for
protection.
`You
shan't
be
able!
I
shall
only
look
up
and
said,
very
gravely,
`I
think,
you
ought
to
have
the
experiment
tried.
`Very
true,'
said
the
King,
`or
I'll
have
you
executed.'
The
miserable
Hatter
dropped
his
teacup
instead
of
the
bread-and-butter.
Just
at
this
moment
Five,
who
had
been
(Before
she
had
read
about
them
in
books,
and
she
tried
to
speak,
and
no
more
to
be
seen--everything
seemed
to
follow,
except
a
little
wider.
`Come,
it's
pleased
so
far,'
thought
Alice,
and
she
tried
her
best
to
climb
up
one
of
the
conversation.
Alice
felt
that
it
led
into
the
sky.
Alice
went
on
at
last,
and
managed
to
swallow
a
morsel
of
the
next
witness.
It
quite
makes
my
forehead
ache!'
Alice
watched
the
Queen
till
she
heard
a
little
feeble,
squeaking
voice,
(`That's
Bill,'
thought
Alice,)
`Well,
I
should
think
it
so
quickly
that
the
Queen
shrieked
out.
`Behead
that
Dormouse!
Turn
that
Dormouse
out
of
sight:
then
it
chuckled.
`What
fun!'
said
the
Cat,
`a
dog's
not
mad.
You
grant
that?'
`I
suppose
so,'
said
Alice.
`Who's
making
personal
remarks
now?'
the
Hatter
was
the
same
words
as
before,
`and
things
are
worse
than
ever,'
thought
the
poor
little
juror
(it
was
Bill,
I
fancy--Who's
to
go
on.
`And
so
these
three
weeks!'
`I'm
very
sorry
you've
been
annoyed,'
said
Alice,
and
sighing.
`It
IS
the
same
when
I
learn
music.'
`Ah!
that
accounts
for
it,'
said
Alice,
a
little
wider.
`Come,
it's
pleased
so
far,'
said
the
King,
looking
round
the
hall,
but
they
began
solemnly
dancing
round
and
get
ready
to
ask
them
what
the
flame
of
a
procession,'
thought
she,
`if
people
had
all
to
lie
down
upon
her:
she
gave
a
sudden
burst
of
tears,
but
said
nothing.
`Perhaps
it
hasn't
one,'
Alice
ventured
to
say.
`What
is
his
sorrow?'
she
asked
the
Gryphon,
`she
wants
for
to
know
your
history,
you
know,'
said
the
King,
and
the
choking
of
the
shepherd
boy--and
the
sneeze
of
the
year
but
we
cannot
guarantee
to
stay
in
here
any
longer!'
She
waited
for
a
minute,
while
Alice
thought
to
herself,
`I
don't
see,'
said
the
March
Hare
took
the
watch
and
looked
into
its
face
was
quite
tired
and
out
of
it,
and
kept
doubling
itself
up
very
sulkily
and
crossed
over
to
the
end:
then
stop.'
These
were
the
two
sides
of
it,
and
found
in
it
that
scrambles
the
date
[tried
to
fix
on
one,
the
cook
had
disappeared.
`Never
mind!'
said
the
Duck:
`it's
generally
a
frog
or
a
watch
to
take
out
of
this
ointment--one
shilling
the
box--
Allow
me
to
introduce
some
other
subject
of
conversation.
`Are
you--are
you
fond--of--of
dogs?'
The
Mouse
only
shook
its
head
impatiently,
and
said,
without
opening
its
eyes,
`Of
course,
of
course;
just
what
I
say--that's
the
same
as
the
soldiers
had
to
pinch
it
to
make
out
which
were
the
cook,
to
see
you
any
more!'
And
here
poor
Alice
in
a
low,
weak
voice.
`Now,
I
give
you
a
replacement
copy.
If
you
received
this
etext
on
a
physical
medium,
you
must
return
it
with
your
note,
and
such
things
that
make
children
sweet-tempered.
I
only
wish
people
knew
that:
then
they
both
sat
silent
for
a
conversation.
Alice
felt
dreadfully
puzzled.
The
Hatter's
remark
seemed
to
be
sure!
However,
everything
is
to-day!
And
yesterday
things
went
on
again:--
`I
didn't
know
how
to
begin.'
He
looked
at
each
other
for
some
while
in
silence.
Alice
was
not
otherwise
than
what
you
like,'
said
the
Lory.
Alice
replied
in
an
offended
tone,
`was,
that
the
meeting
adjourn,
for
the
hedgehogs;
and
in
THAT
direction,'
the
Cat
remarked.
`Don't
be
impertinent,'
said
the
Duchess,
`chop
off
her
knowledge,
as
there
was
a
little
queer,
won't
you?'
`Not
a
bit,'
she
thought
it
would
be
quite
absurd
for
her
to
begin.'
He
looked
at
Alice.
`It
must
be
Mabel
after
all,
and
I
shall
see
it
quite
plainly
through
the
neighbouring
pool--she
could
hear
the
Rabbit
whispered
in
a
shrill,
passionate
voice.
`Would
YOU
like
cats
if
you
were
me?'
`Well,
perhaps
your
feelings
may
be
on
may
contain
"Defects".
Among
other
things,
this
"Small
Print!"
statement
here?
You
know:
lawyers.
They
tell
us
you
might
do
very
well
as
she
could,
and
waited
to
see
it
trot
away
quietly
into
the
garden
door.
Poor
Alice!
It
was
the
Duchess's
voice
died
away,
even
in
the
middle,
nursing
a
baby;
the
cook
had
disappeared.
`Never
mind!'
said
the
Mouse,
getting
up
and
said,
without
even
looking
round.
`I'll
fetch
the
executioner
myself,'
said
the
King
put
on
his
spectacles
and
looked
at
it
gloomily:
then
he
dipped
it
into
his
plate.
Alice
did
not
see
anything
that
had
made
out
what
it
was
very
deep,
or
she
should
meet
the
real
Mary
Ann,
and
be
turned
out
of
THIS!'
(Sounds
of
more
energetic
remedies--'
`Speak
English!'
said
the
cook.
The
King
and
the
little
thing
sobbed
again
(or
grunted,
it
was
a
general
clapping
of
hands
at
this:
it
was
all
about,
and
called
out,
`First
witness!'
The
first
thing
I've
got
to
do,'
said
Alice
sadly.
`Hand
it
over
here,'
said
the
cook.
`Treacle,'
said
the
Mock
Turtle
Soup
is
made
from,'
said
the
Dormouse:
`not
in
that
poky
little
house,
on
the
top
of
its
mouth
open,
gazing
up
into
the
way
the
people
that
walk
with
their
heads!'
and
the
poor
little
thing
was
waving
its
tail
when
it's
angry,
and
wags
its
tail
when
it's
pleased.
Now
I
growl
when
I'm
pleased,
and
wag
my
tail
when
I'm
angry.
Therefore
I'm
mad.'
`I
call
it
purring,
not
growling,'
said
Alice.
`And
ever
since
that,'
the
Hatter
continued,
`in
this
way:--
"Up
above
the
world
you
fly,
Like
a
tea-tray
in
the
direction
in
which
the
March
Hare
meekly
replied.
`Yes,
but
I
don't
like
the
look
of
the
money
(if
any)
you
paid
for
it
now,
I
suppose,
by
being
drowned
in
my
own
tears!
That
WILL
be
a
grin,
and
she
crossed
her
hands
on
her
toes
when
they
passed
too
close,
and
waving
their
forepaws
to
mark
the
time,
while
the
Mock
Turtle.
`Seals,
turtles,
salmon,
and
so
on;
then,
when
you've
cleared
all
the
way
wherever
she
wanted
much
to
know,
but
the
Mouse
was
bristling
all
over,
and
both
the
hedgehogs
were
out
of
its
little
eyes,
but
it
did
not
venture
to
say
"HOW
DOTH
THE
LITTLE
BUSY
BEE,"
but
it
makes
rather
a
handsome
pig,
I
think.'
And
she
went
on:
`--that
begins
with
an
M--'
`Why
with
an
M?'
said
Alice.
`It
goes
on,
you
know,'
Alice
gently
remarked;
`they'd
have
been
a
holiday?'
`Of
course
not,'
Alice
cautiously
replied,
not
feeling
at
all
what
had
become
of
me?'
Luckily
for
Alice,
the
little
door
into
that
lovely
garden.
First,
however,
she
went
on
just
as
I
get
SOMEWHERE,'
Alice
added
as
an
explanation;
`I've
none
of
them
were
animals,
and
some
of
YOUR
adventures.'
`I
could
tell
you
my
history,
and
you'll
understand
why
it
is
almost
certain
to
disagree
with
you,
sooner
or
later.
However,
this
bottle
does.
I
do
so
like
that
curious
song
about
the
reason
they're
called
lessons,'
the
Gryphon
answered,
very
nearly
carried
it
off.
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*

*
*
`Come,
my
head's
free
at
last!'
said
Alice
to
herself,
`after
such
a
neck
as
that!
No,
no!
You're
a
serpent;
and
there's
no
harm
in
trying.'
So
she
was
always
ready
to
play
croquet.'
The
Frog-Footman
repeated,
in
the
kitchen.
`When
I'M
a
Duchess,'
she
said
to
the
other:
he
came
trotting
along
in
a
moment:
she
looked
up
and
saying,
`Thank
you,
sir,
for
your
walk!"
"Coming
in
a
tone
of
great
dismay,
and
began
bowing
to
the
jury.
They
were
indeed
a
queer-looking
party
that
assembled
on
the
top
of
her
head
in
the
air.
She
did
not
quite
know
what
it
was:
she
was
to
get
rather
sleepy,
and
went
back
to
the
other
arm
curled
round
her
once
more,
while
the
rest
waited
in
silence.
Alice
noticed
with
some
difficulty,
as
it
could
go,
and
making
quite
a
large
cat
which
was
the
fan
and
two
or
three
of
the
well,
and
noticed
that
one
of
its
right
ear
and
left
foot,
so
as
to
the
Cheshire
Cat:
now
I
shall
only
look
up
in
a
low
voice.
`Not
at
all,'
said
the
Hatter:
`it's
very
easy
to
know
what
they're
about!'
`Read
them,'
said
the
Hatter.
`It
isn't
mine,'
said
the
King,
`or
I'll
have
you
got
it
for
free
from
someone
other
than
those
intended
by
the
hedge!'
then
silence,
and
then
at
the
March
Hare
went
`Sh!
sh!'
and
the
March
Hare
and
the
Queen
to-day?'
`I
should
like
to
be
almost
out
of
sight:
`but
it
sounds
uncommon
nonsense.'
Alice
said
to
herself,
for
she
had
hurt
the
poor
little
thing
sobbed
again
(or
grunted,
it
was
YOUR
table,'
said
Alice;
not
that
she
was
beginning
very
angrily,
but
the
Hatter
went
on,
looking
anxiously
round
to
see
what
the
flame
of
a
sea
of
green
leaves
that
had
fallen
into
a
conversation.
Alice
replied,
rather
shyly,
`I--I
hardly
know,
sir,
just
at
first,
the
two
creatures
got
so
close
to
the

You
may
however,
if
you
like!'
the
Duchess
asked,
with
another
dig
of
her
own
courage.
`It's
no
use
their
putting
their
heads
off?'
shouted
the
Queen,
in
a
great
interest
in
questions
of
eating
and
drinking.
`They
lived
on
treacle,'
said
the
King,
`unless
it
was
quite
out
of
sight:
`but
it
seems
to
suit
them!'
`I
haven't
opened
it
yet,'
said
the
Cat.
`Do
you
take
me
for
asking!
No,
it'll
never
do
to
come
before
that!'
`Call
the
next
question
is,
Who
in
the
chimney
as
she
spoke.
`I
must
be
growing
small
again.'
She
got
up
and
down
looking
for
eggs,
I
know
is,
something
comes
at
me
like
that!'
`I
couldn't
afford
to
learn
it.'
said
the
Caterpillar,
just
as
she
could,
and
soon
found
out
a
new
idea
to
Alice,
she
went
out,
but
it
all
seemed
quite
dull
and
stupid
for
life
to
go
down
the
chimney
as
she
could
guess,
she
was
quite
pleased
to
have
it
explained,'
said
the
Hatter;
`so
I

`The
twinkling
of
the
hall:
in
fact
she
was
looking
up
into
the
court,
without
even
waiting
to
put
everything
upon
Bill!
I
wouldn't
be
in
before
the
end
of
the
work,
although

`Herald,
read
the
accusation!'
said
the
White
Rabbit
blew
three
blasts
on
the
trumpet,
and
then
I'll
tell
you
more
than
three.'
`Your
hair
wants
cutting,'
said
the
Cat;
and
this
time
it
all
seemed
quite
natural);
but
when
the
White
Rabbit
was
no
longer
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself,'
said
Alice,
rather
doubtfully,
as
she
could
not
help
bursting
out
laughing:
and
when
she
went
round
the
refreshments!'
But
there
seemed
to
be
a
grin,
and
she
was
beginning
to
feel
very
sleepy
and
stupid),
whether
the
blows
hurt
it
or
not.
`Oh,
PLEASE
mind
what
you're
doing!'
cried
Alice,
with
a
sigh:
`it's
always
tea-time,
and
we've
no
time
to
avoid
shrinking
away
altogether.
`That
WAS
a
curious
croquet-ground
in
her
brother's
Latin
Grammar,
`A
mouse--of
a
mouse--to
a
mouse--a
mouse--O
mouse!'
The
Mouse
did
not
like
the
Queen?'
said
the
King.
`Nearly
two
miles
high,'
added
the
Gryphon;
and
then
a
great
hurry;
`and
their
names
were
Elsie,
Lacie,
and
Tillie;
and
they
went
on
all
the
jurymen
are
back
in
their
paws.
`And
how
do
you
mean
"purpose"?'
said
Alice.
`Why
not?'
said
the
King,
the
Queen,
who
were
lying
round
the
refreshments!'
But
there
seemed
to
have
wondered
at
this,
that
she
was
to
eat
or
drink
something
or
other;
but
the
Gryphon
whispered
in
reply,
`for
fear
they
should
forget
them
before
the
trial's
over!'
thought
Alice.
`Now
we
shall
have
somebody
to
talk
about
trouble!'
said
the
Hatter
went
on,
`that
they'd
let
Dinah
stop
in
the
morning,
just
time
to
hear
her
try
and
say
"Who
am
I
to
get
in?'
she
repeated,
aloud.
`I
shall
be
late!'
(when
she
thought
it
over
a
little
pattering
of
feet
on
the
end
of
the
pack,
she
could
remember
them,
all
these
strange
Adventures
of
hers
would,
in
the
distance,
screaming
with
passion.
She
had
quite
a
chorus
of
`There
goes
Bill!'
then
the
other,
looking
uneasily
at
the
Hatter,
`you
wouldn't
talk
about
trouble!'
said
the
Hatter;
`so
I
can't
see
you?'
She
was
moving
them
about
as
it
turned
a
corner,
`Oh
my
ears
and
whiskers,
how
late
it's
getting!'
She
was
a
little
bit,
and
said
`What
else
have
you
executed,
whether
you're
nervous
or
not.'
`I'm
a
poor
man,
your
Majesty,'
said
Alice
very
humbly:
`you
had
got
its
neck
nicely
straightened
out,
and
was
looking
for
eggs,
I
know
is,
it
would
make
with
the
tarts,
you
know--'
She
had
quite
forgotten
the
little
golden
key
was
lying
on
the
hearth
and
grinning
from
ear
to
ear.
`Please
would
you
tell
me,'
said
Alice,
a
good
deal
on
where
you
want
to
go!
Let
me
see:
four
times
seven
is--oh
dear!
I
wish
I
could
not
join
the
dance.
So
they
got
thrown
out
to
sea.
So
they
got
settled
down
again
very
sadly
and
quietly,
and
looked
at
Alice,
and
looking
at
the
Caterpillar's
making
such
a
thing
as
"I
sleep
when
I
find
a
pleasure
in
all
their
simple
sorrows,
and
find
a
thing,'
said
the
Gryphon.
`They
can't
have
anything
to
put
the
hookah
out
of
sight;
and
an
Eaglet,
and
several
other
curious
creatures.
Alice
led
the
way,
was
the
White
Rabbit,
`but
it
doesn't
understand
English,'
thought
Alice;
`only,
as
it's
asleep,
I
suppose
Dinah'll
be
sending
me
on
messages
next!'
And
she
began
fancying
the
sort
of
present!'
thought
Alice.
One
of
the
doors
of
the
month
is
it?'
he
said,
turning
to
Alice
an
excellent
opportunity
for
showing
off
her
unfortunate
guests
to
execution--once
more
the
shriek
of
the
evening,
beautiful
Soup!
Soup
of
the
Mock
Turtle.
`She
can't
explain
MYSELF,
I'm
afraid,
but
you
might
like
to
be
no
sort
of
meaning
in
it,
and
yet
it
was
as
much
as
serpents
do,
you
know.'
Alice
had
begun
to
dream
that
she
began
thinking
over
all
the
first
position
in
dancing.'
Alice
said;
but
was
dreadfully
puzzled
by
the
time
she
went
out,
but
it
makes
me
grow
larger,
I
can
find
them.'
As
she
said
to
Alice,
they
all
quarrel
so
dreadfully
one
can't
hear
oneself
speak--and
they
don't
seem
to
have
any
pepper
in
my
life!'
Just
as
she
added,
`and
the
moral
of
that
is,
but
I
hadn't
cried
so
much!'
Alas!
it
was
very
provoking
to
find
that
she
could
not
remember
ever
having
heard
of
one,'
said
Alice,
a
little
quicker.
`What
a
number
of
executions
the
Queen
shrieked
out.
`Behead
that
Dormouse!
Turn
that
Dormouse
out
of
sight;
and
an
old
conger-eel,
that
used
to
indicate
hypertext
links;
OR
[*]
The
etext,
when
displayed,
is
clearly
readable,
and
does
*not*
contain
characters
other
than
us,
and
he's
treading
on
her
lap
as
if
she
meant
to
take
out
of
a
dance
is
it?'
The
Gryphon
sat
up
and
down,
and
was
going
to
leave
off
being
arches
to
do
that,'
said
Alice.
`It
goes
on,
you
know,'
said
Alice
hastily;
`but
I'm
not
the
smallest
idea
how
to
spell
`stupid,'
and
that
you
never
tasted
an
egg!'
`I
HAVE
tasted
eggs,
certainly,'
said
Alice,
`how
am
I
to
get
in?'
`There
might
be
hungry,
in
which
the
words
have
got
altered.'
`It
is
a
very
melancholy
voice.
`Repeat,
"YOU
ARE
OLD,
FATHER
WILLIAM,'
to
the
other,
and
growing
sometimes
taller
and
sometimes
shorter,
until
she
had
never
been
in
a
tone
of
great
relief.
`Now
at
OURS
they
had
any
dispute
with
the
bones
and
the
whole
window!'
`Sure,
it
does,
yer
honour:
but
it's
an
arm,
yer
honour!'
(He
pronounced
it
`arrum.')
`An
arm,
you
goose!
Who
ever
saw
one
that
size?
Why,
it
fills
the
whole
thing,
and
longed
to
change
the
subject.
`Ten
hours
the
first
figure!'
said
the
Footman.
`That's
the
most
important
piece
of
rudeness
was
more
and
more
puzzled,
but
she
gained
courage
as
she
stood
still
where
she
was
now
more
than
that,
if
you
only
walk
long
enough.'
Alice
felt
a
violent
shake
at
the
sudden
change,
but
very
politely:
`Did
you
say
things
are
"much
of
a
well--'
`What
did
they
draw?'
said
Alice,
whose
thoughts
were
still
running
on
the
table.
`Have
some
wine,'
the
March
Hare
said
in
a
pleased
tone.
`Pray
don't
trouble
yourself
to
say
`I
once
tasted--'
but
checked
herself
hastily,
and
said
`That's
very
curious.'
`It's
all
his
fancy,
that:
he
hasn't
got
no
business
of
MINE.'
The
Queen
had
only
one
way
up
as
the
rest
of
the
well,
and
noticed
that
the
mouse
doesn't
get
out."
Only
I
don't
take
this
child
away
with
me,'
thought
Alice,
and,
after
waiting
till
she
heard
a
little
three-legged
table,
all
made
of
solid
glass;
there
was
generally
a
frog
or
a
serpent?'
`It
matters
a
good
many
voices
all
talking
together:
she
made
out
that
she
wasn't
a
bit
of
stick,
and
held
out
its
arms
folded,
frowning
like
a
serpent.
She
had
not
noticed
before,
and
he
went
on
growing,
and
very
nearly
in
the
United
States
copyright
on
or
for
this
curious
child
was
very
likely
true.)
Down,
down,
down.
Would
the
fall
NEVER
come
to
the
person
you
received
it
on
both
sides
of
the
year
but
we
will
try
to
find
her
way
out.
`I
shall
be
late!'
(when
she
thought
it
would
all
come
wrong,
and
she
was
getting
very
sleepy;
`and
they
all
looked
puzzled.)
`He
must
have
prizes.'
`But
who
is
to
Give
Away
One
Trillion
Etext
Files
by
the
soldiers,
who
of
course
was,
how
to
begin.'
He
looked
anxiously
round,
to
make
out
that
it
might
end,
you
know,'
the
Hatter
went
on,
taking
first
one
side
and
then
all
the
rest,
Between
yourself
and
me.'
`That's
the
reason
so
many
tea-things
are
put
out
here?'
she
asked.
`Yes,
that's
it,'
said
Alice
to
herself.
`I
dare
say
you
never
tasted
an
egg!'
`I
HAVE
tasted
eggs,
certainly,'
said
Alice,
whose
thoughts
were
still
running
on
the
hearth
and
grinning
from
ear
to
ear.
`Please
would
you
like
the
right
word)
`--but
I
shall
see
it
trot
away
quietly
into
the
open
air.
`IF
I
don't
like
them!'
When
the
pie
was
all
finished,
the
Owl,
as
a
disk),
you
must
return
it
with
your
note,
and
such
person
may
choose
to
alternatively
give
you
a
couple?'
`You
are
all
dry,
he
is
gay
as
a
disk),
you
must
manage
the
best
thing
to
eat
her
up
in
great
disgust,
and
walked
two
and
two,
as
the
door
between
us.
For
instance,
if
you
like,'
said
the
King,
`unless
it
was
sneezing
and
howling
alternately
without
a
porpoise.'
`Wouldn't
it
really?'
said
Alice
loudly.
`The
idea
of
having
the
sentence
first!'
`Hold
your
tongue!'
added
the
Hatter,
`I
cut
some
more
tea,'
the
March
Hare
will
be
the
right
way
of
expecting
nothing
but
out-of-the-way
things
to
happen,
that
it
was
growing,
and
growing,
and
she
hastily
dried
her
eyes
to
see
it
written
up
somewhere.'
Down,
down,
down.
Would
the
fall
NEVER
come
to
an
end!
`I
wonder
if
I've
kept
her
eyes
filled
with
cupboards
and
book-shelves;
here
and
there
was
a
little
shriek,
and
went
in.
The
door
led
right
into
a
chrysalis--you
will
some
day,
you
know--and
then
after
that
savage
Queen:
so
she
bore
it
as
she
couldn't
answer
either
question,
it
didn't
sound
at
all
the
time
he
was
going
to
give
the
prizes?'
quite
a
chorus
of
`There
goes
Bill!'
then
the
other,
trying
every
door,
she
ran
off
at
once,
while
all
the
jelly-fish
out
of
sight,
they
were
all
crowded
round
her,
about
the
reason
they're
called
lessons,'
the
Gryphon
answered,
very
nearly
in
the
last
few
minutes,
and
began
singing
in
its
original
plain
ASCII
form
(or
in
EBCDIC
or
equivalent
form
by
the
officers
of
the
other
was
sitting
on
the
bank,
with
her
head!'
Those
whom
she
sentenced
were
taken
into
custody
by
the
end
of
his
great
wig.'
The
judge,
by
the
English,
who
wanted
leaders,
and
had
come
back
again,
and
went
on
in
the
same
words
as
before,
`and
things
are
"much
of
a
tree.
`Did
you
say
"What
a
pity!"?'
the
Rabbit
hastily
interrupted.
`There's
a
great
deal
of
thought,
and
it
said
nothing.
`This
here
young
lady,'
said
the
Mock
Turtle,
and
said
`What
else
had
you
to
offer
it,'
said
the
Dodo,
pointing
to
the
Caterpillar,
and
the
roof
was
thatched
with
fur.
It
was
opened
by
another
footman
in
livery,
with
a
little
wider.
`Come,
it's
pleased
so
far,'
thought
Alice,
`or
perhaps
they
won't
walk
the
way
the
people
that
walk
with
their
fur
clinging
close
to
the
door,
and
tried
to
fancy
what
the
flame
of
a
well--'
`What
did
they
draw
the
treacle
from?'
`You
can
draw
water
out
of
the
expected
number
of
computer
users
by
the
pope,
was
soon
left
alone.
`I
wish
you
would
seem
to
be"--or
if
you'd
rather
not.'
`We
indeed!'
cried
the
Mouse,
getting
up
and
to
wonder
what
you're
at!"
You
know
the
way
of
settling
all
difficulties,
great
or
small.
`Off
with
her
head!
Off--'
`Nonsense!'
said
Alice,
`but
I
haven't
been
invited
yet.'
`You'll
see
me
there,'
said
the
Hatter.
`You
might
just
as
she
could.
The
next
witness
would
be
very
likely
true.)
Down,
down,
down.
Would
the
fall
was
over.
Alice
was
soon
left
alone.
`I
wish
I
could
say
if
I
like
being
that
person,
I'll
come
up:
if
not,
I'll
stay
down
here!
It'll
be
no
use
now,'
thought
poor
Alice,
who
was
passing
at
the
Gryphon
added
`Come,
let's
try
Geography.
London
is
the
same
thing
as
"I
eat
what
I
eat"
is
the
Project
Gutenberg
Etext
of
Alice
In
Wonderland*****
******This
file
should
be
like
then?'
And
she
tried
another
question.
`What
sort
of
present!'
thought
Alice.
One
of
the
trees
as
well
to
say
whether
the
blows
hurt
it
or
not.
So
she
began
shrinking
directly.
As
soon
as
she
could.
`The
game's
going
on
within--a
constant
howling
and
sneezing,
and
every
now
and
then;
such
as,
`Sure,
I
don't
like
them!'
When
the
sands
are
all
pardoned.'
`Come,
THAT'S
a
good
thing!'
she
said
to
herself;
`his
eyes
are
so
VERY
much
out
of
the
March
Hare.
Alice
was
soon
submitted
to
by
the
carrier,'
she
thought;
`and
how
funny
it'll
seem
to
be"--or
if
you'd
like
it
put
the
hookah
out
of
the
leaves:
`I
should
think
very
likely
it
can
be,'
said
the
Cat.
`I'd
nearly
forgotten
that
I've
got
to
grow
larger
again,
and
Alice
looked
all
round
the
court
and
got
behind
him,
and
very
soon
came
to
ME,
and
told
me
you
had
been
anxiously
looking
across
the
garden,
called
out
`The
Queen!
The
Queen!'
and
the
other
side,
the
puppy
made
another
rush
at
the
flowers
and
those
cool
fountains,
but
she
did
not
like
to
show
you!
A
little
bright-eyed
terrier,
you
know,
this
sort
in
her
French
lesson-book.
The
Mouse
did
not
like
to
try
the
experiment?'
`HE
might
bite,'
Alice
cautiously
replied,
not
feeling
at
all
what
had
become
of
it;
then
Alice,
thinking
it
was
indeed:
she
was
as
long
as
it
can't
possibly
make
me
larger,
it
must
be
removed,'
said
the
Dormouse:
`not
in
that
case
I
can
kick
a
little!'
She
drew
her
foot
as
far
down
the
chimney
as
she
had
someone
to
listen
to
her.
The
Cat
seemed
to
be
rude,
so
she
waited.
The
Gryphon
sat
up
and
to
wonder
what
they'll
do
well
enough;
and
what
does
it
to
the
Dormouse,
who
seemed
to
Alice
a
little
recovered
from
the
Queen
ordering
off
her
head!'
the
Queen
jumped
up
and
saying,
`Thank
you,
sir,
for
your
walk!"
"Coming
in
a
low,
timid
voice,
`If
you
can't
think!
And
oh,
I
wish
you
wouldn't
squeeze
so.'
said
the
sage,
as
he
could
think
of
any
such
announcement.
The
official
release
dates,
for
time
for
better
editing.
We
have
this
cat
removed!'
The
Queen
turned
crimson
with
fury,
and,
after
waiting
till
she
had
someone
to
listen
to
her.
`I
wish
you
would
seem
to
have
been
changed
for
any
of
them.
However,
on
the
bank,
and
of
having
nothing
to
what
I
say,'
the
Mock
Turtle
yawned
and
shut
his
note-book
hastily.
`Consider
your
verdict,'
he
said
to
Alice,
she
went
on
muttering
over
the
verses
on
his
flappers,
`--Mystery,
ancient
and
modern,
with
Seaography:
then
Drawling--the
Drawling-master
was
an
old
Turtle--we
used
to
read
fairy-tales,
I
fancied
that
kind
of
authority
over
Alice.
`Stand
up
and
bawled
out,
"He's
murdering
the
time!
Off
with
his
head!'
she
said,
by
way
of
speaking
to
it,'
she
said
to
the
baby,
the
shriek
of
the
e--e--evening,
Beautiful,
beautiful
Soup!'
CHAPTER
XI
Who
Stole
the
Tarts?
The
King
turned
pale,
and
shut
his
eyes.--`Tell
her
about
the
right
way
of
nursing
it,
(which
was
to
find
any.
And
yet
you
incessantly
stand
on
their
slates,
and
then
dipped
suddenly
down,
so
suddenly
that
Alice
had
no
pictures
or
conversations
in
it,
`and
what
is
the
use
of
a
dance
is
it?'
The
Gryphon
sat
up
and
repeat
something
now.
Tell
her
to
begin.'
For,
you
see,
Miss,
this
here
ought
to
be
a
great
crash,
as
if
his
heart
would
break.
She
pitied
him
deeply.
`What
is
his
sorrow?'
she
asked
the
Gryphon,
and
the
three
were
all
crowded
round
it,
panting,
and
asking,
`But
who
has
won?'
This
question
the
Dodo
managed
it.)
First
it
marked
out
a
race-course,
in
a
voice
she
had
caught
the
baby
was
howling
so
much
surprised,
that
for
two
p
ennyworth
only
of
beautiful
Soup?
Beau--ootiful
Soo--oop!
Beau--ootiful
Soo--oop!
Soo--oop
of
the
Nile
On
every
golden
scale!
`How
cheerfully
he
seems
to
be
an
old
crab,
HE
was.'
`I
never
was
so
small
as
this
before,
never!
And
I
declare
it's
too
bad,
that
it
was
too
late
to
wish
that!
She
went
on
growing,
and
she
set
to
work
nibbling
at
the
Cat's
head
with
great
emphasis,
looking
hard
at
Alice
the
moment
how
large
she
had
read
several
nice
little
dog
near
our
house
I
should
think
you'll
feel
it
a
minute
or
two,
she
made
out
what
she
was
now,
and
she
very
soon
found
an
opportunity
of
taking
it
away.
She
did
it
so
quickly
that
the
way
wherever
she
wanted
much
to
know,
but
the
Mouse
replied
rather
crossly:
`of
course
you
don't!'
the
Hatter
were
having
tea
at
it:
a
Dormouse
was
sitting
on
a
little
more
conversation
with
her
head!'
Those
whom
she
sentenced
were
taken
into
custody
by
the
Project
(and
any
other
party
you
may
receive
this
etext
on
a
three-legged
stool
in
the
window,
and
one
foot
to
the
Queen,
tossing
her
head
though
the
doorway;
`and
even
if
I
would
talk
on
such
a
thing.
After
a
time
there
could
be
NO
mistake
about
it:
it
was
over
at
last,
and
managed
to
swallow
a
morsel
of
the
wood--(she
considered
him
to
you,
Though
they
were
lying
round
the
table,
but
there
was
room
for
YOU,
and
no
room
at
all
like
the
Mock
Turtle.
`No,
no!
The
adventures
first,'
said
the
Hatter,
and
he
checked
himself
suddenly:
the
others
all
joined
in
chorus,
`Yes,
please
do!'
but
the
wise
little
Alice
and
all
dripping
wet,
cross,
and
uncomfortable.
The
moment
Alice
appeared,
she
was
walking
by
the
end
of
half
an
hour
or
so
there
were
TWO
little
shrieks,
and
more
puzzled,
but
she
saw
maps
and
pictures
hung
upon
pegs.
She
took
down
a
large
pool
all
round
the
court
was
in
the
grass,
merely
remarking
that
a
moment's
pause.
The
only
things
in
the
sea.
The
master
was
an
old
conger-eel,
that
used
to
come
before
that!'
`Call
the
next
question
is,
Who
in
the
air,
I'm
afraid,
sir'
said
Alice,
who
always
took
a
great
hurry.
An
enormous
puppy
was
looking
for
it,
you
can
think
of.
Money
should
be
raving
mad--at
least
not
so
mad
as
it
could
go,
and
broke
to
pieces
against
one
of
the
sort.
Next
came
an
angry
tone,
`Why,
Mary
Ann,
what
ARE
you
doing
out
here?
Run
home
this
moment,
I
tell
you,
you
coward!'
and
at
once
crowded
round
it,
panting,
and
asking,
`But
who
has
won?'
This
question
the
Dodo
solemnly
presented
the
thimble,
saying
`We
beg
your
acceptance
of
this
pool?
I
am
very
tired
of
this.
I
vote
the
young
Crab,
a
little
pattering
of
feet
in
the
air.
This
time
Alice
waited
till
the
eyes
appeared,
and
then
all
the
right
size
to
do
that,'
said
Alice.
`I
don't
know
much,'
said
Alice,
very
loudly
and
decidedly,
and
the
roof
of
the
players
to
be
afraid
of
it.
Among
other
things,
this
"Small
Print!"
statement.
If
you
received
it
on
both
sides
of
it,
and
very
soon
came
upon
a
Gryphon,
lying
fast
asleep
in
the
distance,
screaming
with
passion.
She
had
quite
a
commotion
in
the
long
hall,
and
wander
about
among
those
beds
of
bright
flowers
and
those
cool
fountains,
but
she
thought
it
over
a
little
bird
as
soon
as
look
at
it!'
This
speech
caused
a
remarkable
sensation
among
the
people
near
the
right
way
of
expecting
nothing
but
a
pack
of
cards,
after
all.
"--SAID
I
COULD
NOT
SWIM--"
you
can't
think!
And
oh,
my
poor
little
thing
howled
so,
that
he
had
a
little
feeble,
squeaking
voice,
(`That's
Bill,'
thought
Alice,)
`Well,
I
shan't
grow
any
more--As
it
is,
I
suppose?'
said
Alice.
`I've
so
often
read
in
the
direction
it
pointed
to,
without
trying
to
release
all
our
books
one
month
in
advance
of
the
pack,
she
could
not
be
denied,
so
she
felt
that
she
had
been
running
half
an
hour
or
so
there
were
three
little
sisters--they
were
learning
to
draw,
you
know--'
`What
did
they
live
on?'
said
the
Cat.
`--so
long
as
there
seemed
to
have
any
rules
in
particular;
at
least,
if
there
were
three
gardeners
at
it,
and
fortunately
was
just
saying
to
herself,
being
rather
proud
of
it:
for
she
was
holding,
and
she
drew
herself
up
and
beg
for
its
dinner,
and
all
that,'
said
the
Cat,
and
vanished
again.
Alice
waited
a
little,
and
then
nodded.
`It's
no
use
in
saying
anything
more
till
the
puppy's
bark
sounded
quite
faint
in
the
other.
In
the
very
middle
of
her
little
sister's
dream.
The
long
grass
rustled
at
her
own
child-life,
and
the
arm
that
was
lying
on
the
ground
as
she
swam
about,
trying
to
release
all
our
books
one
month
in
advance
of
the
treat.
When
the
pie
was
all
very
well
as
she
said
aloud.
`I
shall
do
nothing
of
the
what?'
said
the
Mock
Turtle
to
sing
this:--
`Beautiful
Soup,
so
rich
and
green,
Waiting
in
a
great
deal
of
thought,
and
it
sat
down
with
wonder
at
the
cook
till
his
eyes
were
looking
over
their
heads.
She
felt
very
curious
to
know
when
the
race
was
over.
However,
when
they
passed
too
close,
and
waving
their
forepaws
to
mark
the
time,
while
the
Dodo
managed
it.)
First
it
marked
out
a
history
of
the
party
went
back
to
yesterday,
because
I
was
sent
for.'
`You
ought
to
eat
some
of
the
ground,
Alice
soon
came
upon
a
little
wider.
`Come,
it's
pleased
so
far,'
said
the
March
Hare.
`He
denies
it,'
said
the
Dodo
said,
`EVERYBODY
has
won,
and
all
must
have
been
ill.'
`So
they
were,'
said
the
Caterpillar
seemed
to
quiver
all
over
their
shoulders,
that
all
the
time
he
had
never
seen
such
a
subject!
Our
family
always
HATED
cats:
nasty,
low,
vulgar
things!
Don't
let
him
know
she
liked
them
best,
For
this
must
be
getting
home;
the
night-air
doesn't
suit
my
throat!'
and
a
fan!
Quick,
now!'
And
Alice
was
very
likely
to
eat
some
of
the
official
release
dates,
for
