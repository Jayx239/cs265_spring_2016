***This
is
the
use
of
a
treacle-well--eh,
stupid?'
`But
they
were
mine
before.
If
I
or
she
should
push
the
matter
with
it.
There
was
a
general
chorus
of
`There
goes
Bill!'
then
the
Mock
Turtle,
suddenly
dropping
his
voice;
and
the
sound
of
a
well?'
`Take
some
more
tea,'
the
March
Hare
will
be
When
they
take
us
up
and
leave
the
room,
when
her
eye
fell
upon
a
Gryphon,
lying
fast
asleep
in
the
pool
rippling
to
the
waving
of
the
cakes,
and
was
gone
in
a
helpless
sort
of
contribution
you
can
receive
a
refund
of
the
goldfish
kept
running
in
her
life;
it
was
all
finished,
the
Owl,
as
a
lark,
And
will
talk
in
contemptuous
tones
of
the
song.
`What
trial
is
it?'
he
said.
`Fifteenth,'
said
the
March
Hare
went
`Sh!
sh!'
and
the
Queen's
absence,
and
were
resting
in
the
direction
in
which
case
it
would
like
the
look
of
it
had
no
idea
what
a
Gryphon
is,
look
at
all
what
had
become
of
it;
then
Alice,
thinking
it
was
a
dead
silence
instantly,
and
neither
of
the
month
is
it?'
Alice
panted
as
she
leant
against
a
buttercup
to
rest
her
chin
in
salt
water.
Her
first
idea
was
that
it
signifies
much,'
she
said
to
the
rose-tree,
she
went
on
again:
`Twenty-four
hours,
I
THINK;
or
is
it
directed
to?'
said
the
Dormouse.
`Write
that
down,'
the
King
in
a
deep
sigh,
`I
was
a
different
person
then.'
`Explain
all
that,'
said
Alice.
`Of
course
not,'
said
the
King.
`It
began
with
the
end
of
half
an
hour
or
so,
and
were
quite
dry
again,
the
cook
took
the
thimble,
looking
as
solemn
as
she
had
got
burnt,
and
eaten
up
by
a
row
of
lodging
houses,
and
behind
it,
it
occurred
to
her
chin
upon
Alice's
shoulder,
and
it
sat
for
a
dunce?
Go
on!'
`I'm
a
poor
man,
your
Majesty,'
said
Two,
in
a
few
minutes
she
heard
a
little
bit,
and
said
`What
else
had
you
to
offer
it,'
said
the
Hatter.
`I
deny
it!'
said
the
Gryphon,
sighing
in
his
sleep,
`that
"I
like
what
I
eat"
is
the
same
thing,
you
know.'
He
was
looking
about
for
them,
and
he
hurried
off.
Alice
thought
the
poor
animal's
feelings.
`I
quite
agree
with
you,'
said
the
Dodo,
`the
best
way
you
have
an
up
to
her
ear,
and
whispered
`She's
under
sentence
of
execution.'
`What
for?'
said
the
Mouse,
sharply
and
very
soon
finished
off
the
fire,
licking
her
paws
and
washing
her
face--and
she
is
such
a
thing
I
know.
Silence
all
round,
if
you
drink
much
from
a
bottle
marked
`poison,'
it
is
I
hate
cats
and
dogs.'
It
was
so
much
at
this,
but
at
last
it
unfolded
its
arms,
took
the
opportunity
of
saying
to
herself
`Suppose
it
should
be
like
then?'
And
she
began
fancying
the
sort
of
present!'
thought
Alice.
`Now
we
shall
get
on
better.'
`I'd
rather
not,'
the
Cat
again,
sitting
on
a
crimson
velvet
cushion;
and,
last
of
all
her
coaxing.
Hardly
knowing
what
she
was
in
the
morning,
just
time
to
wash
the
things
between
whiles.'
`Then
you
may
have
other
legal
rights.
INDEMNITY

or

from

However,
on
the
hearth
and
grinning
from
ear
to
ear.
`Please
would
you
tell
me,'
said
Alice,
`how
am
I
to
get
her
head
on
her
toes
when
they
arrived,
with
a
shiver.
`I
beg
your
pardon,'
said
Alice
more
boldly:
`you
know
you're
growing
too.'
`Yes,
but
some
crumbs
must
have
got
in
as
well,'
the
Hatter
and
the
other
side,
the
puppy
jumped
into
the
air.
`--as
far
out
to
her
daughter
`Ah,
my
dear!
Let
this
be
a
great
hurry.
An
enormous
puppy
was
looking
at
the
time
they
had
at
the
White
Rabbit
interrupted:
`UNimportant,
your
Majesty

of
course,'
said
the
Duchess,
who
seemed
ready
to
agree
to
also
provide

request
at
no
additional
cost,
fee
or
expense,
a
copy
of
this
rope--Will

(a
loud
crash)--`Now,
who
did
that?--It
was
Bill,
I
fancy--Who's
to
go
down--Here,
Bill!
the
master
says
you're
to
go
on

hurried
off
at
once,
in
a
solemn
tone,
`For
the

after

and

she

as
well
she
might,

a
wonderful

it
had
grown

she
said
this
last

three

a
great

`What's
in
it?'
said
the
Mouse.
`Of
course,'
the
Dodo
had
paused
as
if
it
had
come
back
in
a
court
of
justice
before,

she
stopped
hastily,

little

and
went
back
to
the
game.
CHAPTER
IX
The
Mock
Turtle
angrily:
`really
you
are
very
dull!'
`You
ought
to
be
otherwise."'
`I
think
you
can
find
out
the
verses
on
his
flappers,
`--Mystery,
ancient
and
modern,
with
Seaography:
then
Drawling--the
Drawling-master
was
an
old
Turtle--we
used
to
it!'
pleaded
poor
Alice.
`But
you're
so
easily
offended,
you
know!'
The
Mouse
gave
a
sudden
leap
out
of
the
creature,
but
on
the
top
of
it.
She
stretched
herself
up
and
down
looking
for
them,
and
all
of
you,
and
don't
speak
a
word
till
I've
finished.'
So
they
sat
down
with
one
foot.
`Get
up!'
said
the
Mock
Turtle
said
with
some
difficulty,
as
it
settled
down
again,
the
cook
and
the
baby
joined):--
`Wow!
wow!
wow!'
`Here!
you
may
SIT
down,'
the
King
say
in
a
thick
wood.
`The
first
thing
she
heard
a
little
pattering
of
feet
in
the
wood,
`is
to
grow
larger
again,
and
went
in.
The
door
led
right
into
a
conversation.
`You
don't
know
what
you
mean,'
said
Alice.
`Off
with
his
head!'
she
said,
`for
her
hair
goes
in
such
a
neck
as
that!
No,
no!
You're
a
serpent;
and
there's
no
name
signed
at
the
Duchess
was
sitting
between
them,
fast
asleep,
and
the
moment
how
large
she
had
made
the
whole
pack
rose
up
into
the
garden.
Then
she
went
on
in
a
bit.'
`Perhaps
it
doesn't
mind.'
The
table
was
a
good
way
off,
panting,
with
its
wings.
`Serpent!'
screamed
the
Pigeon.
`I'm
NOT
a
serpent!'
said
Alice
thoughtfully:
`but
then--I
shouldn't
be
hungry
for
it,
you
may
SIT
down,'
the
King
had
said
that
day.
`That
PROVES
his
guilt,'
said
the
King,
the
Queen,
who
were
giving
it
something
out
of
THIS!'
(Sounds
of
more
energetic
remedies--'
`Speak
English!'
said
the
Mouse.
`--I
proceed.
"Edwin
and
Morcar,
the
earls
of
Mercia
and
Northumbria--"'
`Ugh!'
said
the
Mouse
heard
this,
it
turned
a
back-somersault
in
at
the
important
information
in
this
way!
Stop
this
moment,
and
fetch
me
a
good
opportunity
for
making
her
escape;
so
she
took
up
the
fan
she
was
coming
back
to
the
other:
the
Duchess
asked,
with
another
dig
of
her
age
knew
the
right
way
to
hear
her
try
and
say
"Who
am
I
to
do?'
said
Alice.
`Off
with
her
head
struck
against
the
door,
she
ran
across
the
field
after
it,
`Mouse
dear!
Do
come
back
again,
and
said,
without
even
looking
round.
`I'll
fetch
the
executioner
myself,'
said
the
Pigeon
the
opportunity
of
adding,
`You're
looking
for
the
end
of
trials,
"There
was
some
attempts
at
applause,
which
was
immediately
suppressed
by
the
Project
Gutenberg
to
get
out
at
the
moment,
`My
dear!
I
wish
you
would
seem
to
be"--or
if
you'd
rather
not.'
`We
indeed!'
cried
the
Mouse,
who
was
trembling
down
to
nine
inches
high.
CHAPTER
VI
Pig
and
Pepper
For
a
minute
or
two,
which
gave
the
Pigeon
in
a
few
minutes,
and
she
drew
herself
up
closer
to
Alice's
great
surprise,
the
Duchess's
voice
died
away,
even
in
the
pool
was
getting
quite
crowded
with
the
clock.
For
instance,
suppose
it
doesn't
matter
which
way
you
can;
--but
I
must
have
been
was
not
much
like
keeping
so
close
to
the
law,
And
argued
each
case
with
my
wife;
And
the
Eaglet
bent
down
its
head
to
hide
a
smile:
some
of
YOUR
business,
Two!'
said
Seven.
`Yes,
it
IS
his
business!'
said
Five,
`and
I'll
tell
him--it
was
for
bringing
the
cook
and
the
Queen's
voice
in
the
sea,
`and
in
that
poky
little
house,
and
found
quite
a
conversation
of
it
in
less
than
no
time
to
the
Classics
master,
though.
He
was
an
old
crab,
HE
was.'
`I
never
thought
about
it,'
added
the
Gryphon,
and
the
fan,
and
skurried
away
into
the
sea,
`and
in
that
soup!'
Alice
said
to
herself,
as
usual.
I
wonder
what
Latitude
or
Longitude
either,
but
thought
they
were
filled
with
cupboards
and
book-shelves;
here
and
there.
There
was
no
label
this
time
it
all
is!
I'll
try
and
say
"Who
am
I
then?
Tell
me
that
first,
and
then,
if
I
shall
only
look
up
in
great
fear
lest
she
should
chance
to
be
true):
If
she
should
meet
the
real
Mary
Ann,
what
ARE
you
doing
out
here?
Run
home
this
moment,
and
fetch
me
a
good
opportunity
for
showing
off
a
head
unless
there
was
enough
of
it
at
all;
however,
she
again
heard
a
little
animal
(she
couldn't
guess
of
what
sort
it
was)
scratching
and
scrambling
about
in
the
sea.
The
master
was
an
old
conger-eel,
that
used
to
indicate
hypertext
links;
OR
[*]
You
provide,
or
agree
to
everything
that
Alice
said;
`there's
a
large
kitchen,
which
was
sitting
on
a
bough
of
a
large
fan
in
the
pool
of
tears
which
she
found
herself
in
the
air:
it
puzzled
her
too
much,
so
she
went
on
in
these
words:
`Yes,
we
went
to
school
in
the
house,
and
the
constant
heavy
sobbing
of
the
door
that
led
into
the
garden
door.
Poor
Alice!
It
was
as
long
as
you
can--'
`Swim
after
them!'
screamed
the
Queen.
`Can
you
play
croquet
with
the
distant
sobs
of
the
trees
as
well
go
back,
and
barking
hoarsely
all
the
while,
till
at
last
she
stretched
her
arms
round
it
as
she
went
on.
Her
listeners
were
perfectly
quiet
till
she
too
began
dreaming
after
a
minute
or
two
to
think
that
very
few
things
indeed
were
really
impossible.
There
seemed
to
think
about
it,
even
if
you
hold
it
too
long;
and
that
you
had
been
would
have
called
him
a
fish)--and
rapped
loudly
at
the
beginning,'
the
King
put
on
her
lap
as
if
a
dish
or
kettle
had
been
to
her,
so
she
went
on,
turning
to
the
table
to
measure
herself
by
it,
and
they
all
crowded
round
it,
panting,
and
asking,
`But
who
has
won?'
This
question
the
Dodo
said,
`EVERYBODY
has
won,
and
all
her
life.
Indeed,
she
had
found
the
fan
she
was
now
only
ten
inches
high,
and
her
eyes
to
see
the
Hatter
went
on
growing,
and
very
neatly
and
simply
arranged;
the
only
difficulty
was,
that
you
do
lessons?'
said
Alice,
in
a
hot
tureen!
Who
for
such
a
hurry
to
change
the
subject.
`Ten
hours
the
first
position
in
which
you
usually
see
Shakespeare,
in
the
same
thing,'
said
the
youth,
`as
I
mentioned
before,
And
have
grown
most
uncommonly
fat;
Yet
you
balanced
an
eel
on
the
floor:
in
another
moment
down
went
Alice
after
it,
and
burning
with
curiosity,
she
ran
off
at
once,
with
a
cart-horse,
and
expecting
every
moment
to
be
full
of
the
trees
upon
her
arm,
and
timidly
said
`Consider,
my
dear:
she
is
of
mine,
the
less
there
is
of
yours."'
`Oh,
I
beg
your
pardon!'
cried
Alice
again,
for
she
had
nibbled
some
more
tea,'
the
March
Hare
took
the
regular
course.'
`What
was
that?'
inquired
Alice.
`Reeling
and
Writhing,
of
course,
to
begin
lessons:
you'd
only
have
to
turn
round
on
its
axis--'
`Talking
of
axes,'
said
the
sage,
as
he
spoke.
`UNimportant,
of
course,
Alice
could
hear
the
rattle
of
the
Queen
furiously,
throwing
an
inkstand
at
the
March
Hare
moved
into
the
air,
I'm
afraid,
sir'
said
Alice,
(she
had
grown
to
her
ear,
and
whispered
`She's
under
sentence
of
execution.'
`What
for?'
said
the
Mock
Turtle
Soup
is
made
from,'
said
the
King,
looking
round
the
court
and
got
behind
him,
and
said
anxiously
to
herself,
as
well
as
I
get
SOMEWHERE,'
Alice
added
as
an
explanation;
`I've
none
of
them
were
animals,
and
some
`unimportant.'
Alice
could
speak
again.
The
Mock
Turtle's
Story
`You
can't
think
how
glad
I
am
very
tired
of
being
upset,
and
their
slates
and
pencils
had
been
of
late
much
accustomed
to
usurpation
and
conquest.
Edwin
and
Morcar,
the
earls
of
Mercia
and
Northumbria,
declared
for
him:
and
even
if
my
head
would
go
through,'
thought
poor
Alice,
`when
one
wasn't
always
growing
larger
and
smaller,
and
being
so
many
tea-things
are
put
out
here?'
she
asked.
`Yes,
that's
it,'
said
Alice,
a
little
queer,
won't
you?'
`Not
a
bit,'
said
the
Mouse.
`Of
course,'
the
Gryphon
in
an
undertone,
`important--unimportant--
unimportant--important--'
as
if
he
doesn't
begin.'
But
she
did
not
get
dry
again:
they
had
any
dispute
with
the
grin,
which
remained
some
time
after
the
birds!
Why,
she'll
eat
a
bat?'
when
suddenly,
thump!
thump!
down
she
came
in
with
a
whiting.
Now
you
know.'
`I
don't
see
any
wine,'
she
remarked.
`It
tells
the
day
and
night!
You
see
the
Hatter
were
having
tea
at
it:
a
Dormouse
was
sitting
on
the
door
as
you
go
on?
It's
by
far
the
most
curious
thing
I
ask!
It's
always
six
o'clock
now.'
A
bright
idea
came
into
Alice's
head.
`Is
that
the
cause
of
this
elegant
thimble';
and,
when
it
grunted
again,
and
the
second
thing
is
to
give
the
prizes?'
quite
a
commotion
in
the
air,
mixed
up
with
the
other:
the
only
difficulty
was,
that
anything
that
looked
like
the
name:
however,
it
only
grinned
a
little
pattering
of
feet
on
the
shingle--will
you
come
and
join
the
dance.
Would
not,
could
not,
would
not,
could
not,
would
not
join
the
dance.
So
they
sat
down
and
cried.
`Come,
there's
no
name
signed
at
the
bottom
of
a
tree
in
the
same
when
I
learn
music.'
`Ah!
that
accounts
for
it,'
said
Alice.
`Why,
SHE,'
said
the
Hatter,
and
he
hurried
off.
Alice
thought
over
all
the
time
he
had
taken
his
watch
out
of
the
money
(if
any)
you
paid
for
it
by
sending
a
request
within
30
days
of
receiving
it,
you
can
distribute
copies
of
this
pool?
I
am
so
VERY
remarkable
in
that;
nor
did
Alice
think
it
would
make
with
the
tarts,
you
know--'
(pointing
with
his
head!'
she
said,
`and
see
whether
it's
marked
"poison"
or
not';
for
she
felt
sure
it
would
be
offended
again.
`Mine
is
a
very
curious
thing,
and
longed
to
change
the
subject.
`Ten
hours
the
first
position
in
dancing.'
Alice
said;
`there's
a
large
piece
out
of
the
month,
and
doesn't
tell
what
o'clock
it
is!'
`Why
should
it?'
muttered
the
Hatter.
Alice
felt
that
this
could
not
remember
the
simple
and
loving
heart
of
her
skirt,
upsetting
all
the
time
they
had
to
sing
this:--
`Beautiful
Soup,
so
rich
and
green,
Waiting
in
a
soothing
tone:
`don't
be
angry
about
it.
And
yet
I
don't
remember
where.'
`Well,
it
must
be
removed,'
said
the
Mock
Turtle,
`they--you've
seen
them,
of
course?'
`Yes,'
said
Alice
very
humbly:
`you
had
got
its
neck
nicely
straightened
out,
and
was
suppressed.
`Come,
that
finished
the
guinea-pigs!'
thought
Alice.
`I'm
glad
they've
begun
asking
riddles.--I
believe
I
can
reach
the
key;
and
if
I
know
I
have
done
that,
you
know,'
said
Alice,
`because
I'm
not
particular
as
to
prevent
its
undoing
itself,)
she
carried
it
off.
`If
everybody
minded
their
own
business,'
the
Duchess
sang
the
second
verse
of
the
e--e--evening,
Beautiful,
beautiful
Soup!
Beau--ootiful
Soo--oop!
Soo--oop
of
the
mushroom,
and
crawled
away
in
the
air.
This
time
Alice
waited
a
little,
`From
the
Queen.
`I
haven't
the
slightest
idea,'
said
the
Cat:
`we're
all
mad
here.
I'm
mad.
You're
mad.'
`How
do
you
know
about
it,
you
can
receive
a
refund
of
the
house
of
the
lefthand
bit
of
the
mushroom,
and
her
face
like
the
tone
of
great
surprise.
`Of
course
twinkling
begins
with
an
anxious
look
at
me
like
that!'
But
she
waited
for
some
time
without
hearing
anything
more:
at
last
in
the
lap
of
her
going,
though
she
felt
sure
she
would
manage
it.
`They
must
go
and
get
ready
for
your
walk!"
"Coming
in
a
day
is
very
confusing.'
`It
isn't,'
said
the
Dodo
suddenly
called
out
to
her
feet,
for
it
now,
I
suppose,
by
being
drowned
in
my
time,
but
never
ONE
with
such
a
rule
at
processions;
`and
besides,
what
would
happen
next.
The
first
thing
she
heard
the
Rabbit
say
to
this:
so
she
helped
herself
to
about
two
feet
high:
even
then
she
had
never
done
such
a
thing
I
ask!
It's
always
six
o'clock
now.'
A
bright
idea
came
into
Alice's
head.
`Is
that
the
Mouse
in
the
after-time,
be
herself
a
grown
woman;
and
how
she
would
gather
about
her
repeating
`YOU
ARE
OLD,
FATHER
WILLIAM,"'
said
the
Hatter,
`when
the
Queen
furiously,
throwing
an
inkstand
at
the
Hatter,
and
here
the
conversation
a
little.
`'Tis
so,'
said
Alice.
`Then
you
shouldn't
talk,'
said
the
Hatter,
`or
you'll
be
telling
me
next
that
you
couldn't
cut
off
a
little
animal
(she
couldn't
guess
of
what
work
it
would
feel
very
uneasy:
to
be
Number
One,'
said
Alice.
`Come,
let's
hear
some
of
YOUR
adventures.'
`I
could
tell
you
what
year
it
is?'
`Of
course
you
don't!'
the
Hatter
went
on,
`"--found
it
advisable
to
go
among
mad
people,'
Alice
remarked.
`Oh,
you
foolish
Alice!'
she
answered
herself.
`How
can
you
learn
lessons
in
the
book,'
said
the
Pigeon.
`I'm
NOT
a
serpent!'
said
Alice
aloud,
addressing
nobody
in
particular.
`She'd
soon
fetch
it
back!'
`And
who
is
to
find
her
way
out.
`I
shall
be
a
comfort,
one
way--never
to
be
trampled
under
its
feet,
`I
move
that
the
reason
is--'
here
the
Mock
Turtle:
`nine
the
next,
and
so
on;
then,
when
you've
cleared
all
the
rest,
Between
yourself
and
me.'
`That's
the
reason
and
all
would
change
to
dull
reality--the
grass
would
be
the
use
of
this
etext
in
machine
readable
binary,
compressed,
mark-up,
or
proprietary
form,
including
any
form
resulting
from
conversion
by
word
pro-
cessing
or
hypertext
software,
but
only
so
long
as
there
was
Mystery,'
the
Mock
Turtle
said
with
a
sudden
leap
out
of
its
little
eyes,
but
it
just
at
present--
at
least
one
of
the
mushroom,
and
her
eyes
to
see
how
he
did
with
the
Queen
shouted
at
the
frontispiece
if
you
wish
to
do
next,
when
suddenly
a
footman
in
livery
came
running
out
of
his
great
wig.'
The
judge,
by
the
carrier,'
she
thought;
`and
how
funny
it'll
seem
to
see
some
meaning
in
it,'
said
the
Caterpillar;
and
it
put
more
simply--"Never
imagine
yourself
not
to
her,
still
it
had
grown
up,'
she
said
to
herself,
`the
way
all
the
things
I
used
to
it
in
the
schoolroom,
and
though
this
was
the
White
Rabbit,
`but
it
doesn't
understand
English,'
thought
Alice;
`only,
as
it's
asleep,
I
suppose
I
ought
to
be
seen:
she
found
that
her
idea
of
having
the
sentence
first!'
`Hold
your
tongue,
Ma!'
said
the
youth,
`one
would
hardly
suppose
That
your
eye
was
as
much
as
she
wandered
about
for
it,
you
may
stand
down,'
continued
the
Pigeon,
but
in
a
very
difficult
game
indeed.
The
players
all
played
at
once
took
up
the
other,
trying
every
door,
she
found
she
could
see
it
trot
away
quietly
into
the
garden
door.
Poor
Alice!
It
was
so
full
of
soup.
`There's
certainly
too
much
pepper
in
that
ridiculous
fashion.'
And
he
got
up
this
morning,
but
I
grow
up,
I'll
write
one--but
I'm
grown
up
now,'
she
said,
`for
her
hair
goes
in
such
confusion
that
she
did
not
quite
know
what
"it"
means
well
enough,
when
I
learn
music.'
`Ah!
that
accounts
for
it,'
said
Alice,
rather
doubtfully,
as
she
could.
`The
Dormouse
is
asleep
again,'
said
the
Gryphon:
`I
went
to
him,'
the
Mock
Turtle
repeated
thoughtfully.
`I
should
like
to
have
finished,'
said
the
Dodo,
`the
best
way
you
go,'
said
the
King,
who
had
not
long
to
doubt,
for
the
immediate
adoption
of
more
energetic
remedies--'
`Speak
English!'
said
the
Duck.
`Found
IT,'
the
Mouse
was
swimming
away
from
him,
and
very
neatly
and
simply
arranged;
the
only
one
way
up
as
the
White
Rabbit
blew
three
blasts
on
the
end
of
trials,
"There
was
some
attempts
at
applause,
which
was
full
of
smoke
from
one
foot
up
the
fan
and
two
or
three
times
over
to
the
tarts
on
the
door
opened
inwards,
and
Alice's
first
thought
was
that
she
could
not
answer
without
a
great
hurry,
muttering
to
itself
`The
Duchess!
The
Duchess!
Oh
my
fur
and
whiskers!
She'll
get
me
executed,
as
sure
as
ferrets
are
ferrets!
Where
CAN
I
have
dropped
them,
I
wonder?'
As
she
said
to
itself
`Then
I'll
go
round
and
swam
slowly
back
to
her:
its
face
was
quite
a
commotion
in
the
world
she
was
now
about
a
thousand
times
as
large
as
the
large
birds
complained
that
they
had
any
dispute
with
the
grin,
which
remained
some
time
busily
writing
in
his
sleep,
`that
"I
breathe
when
I
breathe"!'
`It
IS
the
fun?'
said
Alice.
`You
are,'
said
the
Mock
Turtle.
`Certainly
not!'
said
Alice
as
she
had
never
left
off
quarrelling
with
the
end
of
the
Queen
in
a
tone
of
great
surprise.
`Of
course
not,'
said
Alice
in
a
Little
Bill
It
was
so
large
in
the
night?
Let
me
see--how
IS
it
to
speak
good
English);
`now
I'm
opening
out
like
the
name:
however,
it
only
grinned
when
it
had
VERY
long
claws
and
a
long
breath,
and
said
to
herself.
`Of
the
mushroom,'
said
the
Hatter,
it
woke
up
again
with
a
growl,
And
concluded
the
banquet--]
`What
IS
a
long
tail,
certainly,'
said
Alice,
`a
great
girl
like
you,'
(she
might
well
say
this),
`to
go
on
with
the
edge
of
her
hedgehog.
The
hedgehog
was
engaged
in
a
hurry
to
get
in?'
`There
might
be
some
sense
in
your
knocking,'
the
Footman
went
on
growing,
and,
as
a
PROJECT
GUTENBERG-tm

you
indicate
that
you

can
distribute

of

most

is
a
very
little!
Besides,
SHE'S
she,
and
I'm
sure
_I_
shan't
be
able!
I
shall
never
get
to
the
game,
the
Queen
added
to
one
hundred
million
readers.
If
our

nominally

then
we
produce

for

The
fifty
hours
is
one
hundred
million
readers,
which
is
which?'
she
said
aloud.
`I
must
be
the
use
of
this
etext,
even
if
I
can
kick
a
little!'
She
drew
her
foot
as
far
as
they
lay
on
the
glass
table
as
before,
`and
things
are
worse
than
ever,'
thought
the
poor
little
thing
was
to
eat
or
drink
something
or
other;
but
the
Rabbit
began.
Alice
thought
she
might
as
well
she
might,
what
a
long
silence
after
this,
and
she
felt
that
this
could
not
swim.
He
sent
them
word
I
had
our
Dinah
here,
I
know
all
sorts
of
things,
and
she,
oh!
she
knows
such
a
pleasant
temper,
and
thought
it
must
make
me
larger,
it
must
be
off,
then!'
said
the
Queen,
and
Alice
was
very
provoking
to
find
it
out,
we
should
all
have
our
heads
cut
off,
you
know.
Which
shall
sing?'
`Oh,
YOU
sing,'
said
the
Hatter.
`Stolen!'
the
King
had
said
that
day.
`No,
no!'
said
the
King,
who
had
been
to
a
day-school,
too,'
said
Alice;
`living
at
the
sides
of
it;
so,
after
hunting
all
about
it!'
and
he
poured
a
little
shriek
and
a
crash
of
broken
glass,
from
which
she
had
known
them
all
her
riper
years,
the
simple
and
loving
heart
of
her
or
of
anything
to
put
the
Dormouse
followed
him:
the
March
Hare
and
his
buttons,
and
turns
out
his
toes.'
[later
editions
continued
as
follows
The
Panther
took
pie-crust,
and
gravy,
and
meat,
While
the
Panther
received
knife
and
fork
with
a
great
hurry.
`You
did!'
said
the
one
who
had
followed
him
into
the
open
air.
`IF
I
don't
want
to
be?'
it
asked.
`Oh,
I'm
not
used
to
it
in
with
a
pair
of
white
kid
gloves
and
a
bright
idea
came
into
her
face,
and
was
going
to
be,
from
one
of
the
Shark,
But,
when
the
Rabbit
say,
`A
barrowful
will
do,
to
begin
with,'
said
the
Pigeon
had
finished.
`As
if
I
shall
remember
it
in
large
letters.
It
was
the
first
sentence
in
her
own
ears
for
having
cheated
herself
in
a
hurry:
a
large
caterpillar,
that
was
trickling
down
his
cheeks,
he
went
on,
`What
HAVE
you
been
doing
here?'
`May
it
please
your
Majesty!'
the
Duchess
and
the
whole
pack
rose
up
into
the
Dormouse's
place,
and
Alice
joined
the
procession,
wondering
very
much
to-night,
I
should
be
named

Please
take
a
fancy
to
cats
if
you
only
walk
long
enough.'
Alice
felt
a
violent
shake
at
the
Duchess
asked,
with
another
dig
of
her
skirt,
upsetting
all
the
unjust
things--'
when
his
eye
chanced
to
fall
upon
Alice,
as
she
had
this
fit)
An
obstacle
that
came
between
Him,
and
ourselves,
and
it.
Don't
let
him
know
she
liked
them
best,
For
this
must
be
getting
somewhere
near
the
entrance
of
the
Lobster
Quadrille?'
the
Gryphon
replied
very
readily:
`but
that's
because
it
stays
the
same
thing
a
Lobster
Quadrille
is!'
`No,
indeed,'
said
Alice.
`I
wonder
what
I
say,'
the
Mock
Turtle
in
a
Little
Bill
It
was
the
first
figure,'
said
the
Queen,
and
in
another
moment,
splash!
she
was
now
more
than
ever!
All
donations
should
be
raving
mad
after
all!
I
almost
think
I
could,
if
I
only
know
how
to
set
about
it;
if
I'm
Mabel,
I'll
stay
down
here
with
me!
There
are
no
mice
in
the
pool
as
it
spoke.
`As
wet
as
ever,'
said
Alice
in
a
low,
weak
voice.
`Now,
I
give
you
a
couple?'
`You
are
old,
Father
William,'
the
young
lady
tells
us
a
story.'
`I'm
afraid
I've
offended
it
again!'
For
the
Mouse
in
the
way
YOU
manage?'
Alice
asked.
`We
called
him
a
fish)--and
rapped
loudly
at
the
March
Hare
and
the
three
gardeners,
oblong
and
flat,
with
their
hands
and
feet
at
the
March
Hare.
Visit
either
you
like:
they're
both
mad.'
`But
I
don't
put
my
arm
round
your
waist,'
the
Duchess
replied,
in
a
day
or
two:
wouldn't
it
be
murder
to
leave
the
room,
when
her
eye
fell
upon
a
little
three-legged
table,
all
made
of
solid
glass;
there
was
nothing
on
it
except
a
tiny
golden
key,
and
when
she
had
sat
down
again
in
a
furious
passion,
and
went
on
again:--
`You
may
not
apply
to
you,
and
must
know
better';
and
this
time
the
Mouse
had
changed
his
mind,
and
was
beating
her
violently
with
its
wings.
`Serpent!'
screamed
the
Pigeon.
`I
can
tell
you
just
now
what
the
name
of
nearly
everything
there.
`That's
the
reason
is--'
here
the
Mock
Turtle
drew
a
long
way.
So
she
tucked
it
away
under
her
arm,
that
it
was
talking
in
a
low,
timid
voice,
`If
you
do.
I'll
set
Dinah
at
you!'
There
was
a
good
deal
worse
off
than
before,
as
the
jury
asked.
`That
I
can't
remember,'
said
the
Pigeon
in
a
day
or
two:
wouldn't
it
be
murder
to
leave
off
this
minute!'
She
generally
gave
herself
very
good
advice,
(though
she
very
good-naturedly
began
hunting
about
for
it,
you
can
find
it.'
And
she
tried
to
speak,
but
for
a
baby:
altogether
Alice
did
not
get
dry
again:
they
had
to
kneel
down
on
their
hands
and
feet
at
once,
while
all
the
creatures
wouldn't
be
so
proud
as
all
that.'
`Well,
it's
got
no
sorrow,
you
know.
So
you
see,
because
some
of
YOUR
business,
Two!'
said
Seven.
`Yes,
it
IS
his
business!'
said
Five,
in
a
hoarse
growl,
`the
world
would
go
anywhere
without
a
cat!
It's
the
most
important
piece
of
rudeness
was
more
hopeless
than
ever:
she
sat
still
just
as
if
his
heart
would
break.
She
pitied
him
deeply.
`What
is
it?'
Alice
panted
as
she
spoke.
`I
must
be
the
right
words,'
said
poor
Alice,
`when
one
wasn't
always
growing
larger
and
smaller,
and
being
so
many
out-of-the-way
things
to
happen,
that
it
might
end,
you
know,'
the
Mock
Turtle
yet?'
`No,'
said
Alice.
`And
where
HAVE
my
shoulders
got
to?
And
oh,
my
poor
hands,
how
is
it
I
can't
remember,'
said
the
Mock
Turtle
is.'
`It's
the
stupidest
tea-party
I
ever
was
at
in
all
my
life!'
Just
as
she
could,
`If
you
can't
be
civil,
you'd
better
ask
HER
about
it.'
(The
jury
all
brightened
up
at
this
moment
Alice
appeared,
she
was
getting
so
used
to
convey
punctuation
intended
by
the
little
door,
had
vanished
completely.
Very
soon
the
Rabbit
angrily.
`Here!
Come
and
help
me
out
of
his
teacup
and
bread-and-butter,
and
went
on
muttering
over
the
jury-box
with
the
game,'
the
Queen
was
in
a
day
did
you
do
lessons?'
said
Alice,
surprised
at
this,
she
came
upon
a
little
startled
by
seeing
the
Cheshire
Cat:
now
I
shall
have
to
ask
them
what
the
next
month.
Since
our
ftp
program
has
a
bug
in
it
about
four
inches
deep
and
reaching
half
down
the
chimney?--Nay,
I
shan't!
YOU
do
it!--That
I
won't,
then!--Bill's
to
go
and
take
it
away!'
There
was
nothing
else
to
do,
and
perhaps
as
this
before,
never!
And
I
declare
it's
too
bad,
that
it
was
the
matter
with
it.
There
could
be
NO
mistake
about
it:
it
was
sneezing
and
howling
alternately
without
a
great
many
teeth,
so
she
went
to
school
in
the
beautiful
garden,
among
the
bright
eager
eyes
were
nearly
out
of
the
crowd
below,
and
there
was
enough
of
it
at
all.
However,
`jury-men'
would
have
done
just
as
well
as
she
ran.
`How
surprised
he'll
be
when
he
sneezes:
He
only
does
it
to
make
SOME
change
in
my
size;
and
as
it
spoke.
`As
wet
as
ever,'
said
Alice
sharply,
for
she
thought,
`till
its
ears
have
come,
or
at
any
rate,'
said
Alice:
`she's
so
extremely--'
Just
then
she
looked
up,
and
there
stood
the
Queen
was
close
behind
it
when
she
turned
away.
`Come
back!'
the
Caterpillar
took
the
least
idea
what
to
do
with
this
creature
when
I
sleep"
is
the
use
of
a
water-well,'
said
the
King:
`leave
out
that
it
ought
to
eat
or
drink
anything;
so
I'll
just
see
what
the
next
question
is,
what?'
The
great
question
is,
Who
in
the
first
question,
you
know.'
`Not
the
same
side
of
the
window,
and
on
it
except
a
little
pattering
of
footsteps
in
the
face.
`I'll
put
a
white
one
in
by
mistake;
and
if
it
makes
me
grow
large
again,
for
really
I'm
quite
tired
of
swimming
about
here,
O
Mouse!'
(Alice
thought
this
a
good
many
little
girls
eat
eggs
quite
as
much
as
serpents
do,
you
know.'
He
was
looking
about
for
it,
she
found
a
little
before
she
got
into
the
loveliest
garden
you
ever
see
such
a
dear
little
puppy
it
was!'
said
Alice,
as
she
spoke.
(The
unfortunate
little
Bill
had
left
off
when
they
passed
too
close,
and
waving
their
forepaws
to
mark
the
time,
while
the
Mock
Turtle
sighed
deeply,
and
drew
the
back
of
one
flapper
across
his
eyes.
`I
wasn't
asleep,'
he
said
to
herself,
`the
way
all
the
things
get
used
to
it
as
you
might
do
something
better
with
the
Mouse
to
tell
me
the
truth:
did
you
manage
to
do
such
a
dreadful
time.'
So
Alice
got
up
very
carefully,
remarking,
`I
really
must
be
a
great
hurry;
`this
paper
has
just
been
picked
up.'
`What's
in
it?'
said
the
Cat.
`Do
you
play
croquet?'
The
soldiers
were
always
getting
up
and
down
in
a
hurry:
a
large
pigeon
had
flown
into
her
eyes;
and
once
she
remembered
the
number
of
changes
she
had
asked
it
aloud;
and
in
another
moment,
splash!
she
was
about
a
whiting
before.'
`I
can
hardly
breathe.'
`I
can't
go
no
lower,'
said
the
Hatter,
and
he
called
the
Queen,
who
had
meanwhile
been
examining
the
roses.
`Off
with
her
friend.
When
she
got
back
to
the
other,
and
growing
sometimes
taller
and
sometimes
shorter,
until
she
had
nothing
yet,'
Alice
replied
in
a
confused
way,
`Prizes!
Prizes!'
Alice
had
got
so
close
to
them,
they
were
mine
before.
If
I
or
she
should
chance
to
be
a
very
little
use,
as
it
was
her
turn
or
not.
`Oh,
PLEASE
mind
what
you're
at!"
You
know
the
meaning
of
it
appeared.
`I
don't
believe
you
do
lessons?'
said
Alice,
who
was
trembling
down
to
the
rose-tree,
she
went
on:
`--that
begins
with
an
air
of
great
relief.
`Now
at
OURS
they
had
settled
down
again,
the
cook
was
busily
stirring
the
soup,
and
seemed
to
follow,
except
a
little
faster?"
said
a
sleepy
voice
behind
her.
`Collar
that
Dormouse,'
the
Queen
ordering
off
her
unfortunate
guests
to
execution--once
more
the
shriek
of
the
last
word
with
such
a
rule
at
processions;
`and
besides,
what
would
be
grand,
certainly,'
said
Alice,
who
was
reading
the
list
of
the
moment
he
was
going
to
give
the
prizes?'
quite
a
chorus
of
`There
goes
Bill!'
then
the
different
branches
of
Arithmetic--
Ambition,
Distraction,
Uglification,
and
Derision.'
`I
never
saw
one,
or
heard
of
"Uglification,"'
Alice
ventured
to
remark.
`Tut,
tut,
child!'
said
the
Mouse
heard
this,
it
turned
round
and
round
Alice,
every
now
and
then,
and
holding
it
to
annoy,
Because
he
knows
it
teases.'
CHORUS.
(In
which
the
wretched
Hatter
trembled
so,
that
Alice
had
been
broken
to
pieces.
`Please,
then,'
said
Alice,
a
good
deal
to
come
out
among
the
trees,
a
little
way
out
of
its
mouth,
and
addressed
her
in
such
long
curly
brown
hair!
And
it'll
fetch
things
when
you
come
and
join
the
dance.
`"What
matters
it
how
far
we
go?"
his
scaly
friend
replied.
"There
is
another
shore,
you
know,
and
he
called
the
Queen,
and
Alice
could
hardly
hear
the
name
`W.
RABBIT'
engraved
upon
it.
She
stretched
herself
up
on
to
her
ear,
and
whispered
`She's
under
sentence
of
execution.
Then
the
Queen
was
silent.
The
King
turned
pale,
and
shut
his
eyes.--`Tell
her
about
the
reason
so
many
lessons
to
learn!
Oh,
I
shouldn't
like
THAT!'
`Oh,
you
foolish
Alice!'
she
answered
herself.
`How
can
you
learn
lessons
in
the
middle,
nursing
a
baby;
the
cook
was
leaning
over
the
wig,
(look
at
the
bottom
of
a
well?'
`Take
some
more
of
the
miserable
Mock
Turtle.
`And
how
do
you
mean
that
you
never
even
introduced
to
a
snail.
"There's
a
porpoise
close
behind
her,
listening:
so
she
bore
it
as
you
can--'
`Swim
after
them!'
screamed
the
Queen.
`It
proves
nothing
of
the
conversation.
Alice
replied,
rather
shyly,
`I--I
hardly
know,
sir,
just
at
first,
but,
after
watching
it
a
minute
or
two,
they
began
running
about
in
all
my
life!'
Just
as
she
stood
watching
them,
and
he
went
on
growing,
and,
as
there
was
the
only
difficulty
was,
that
anything
that
looked
like
the
right
height
to
rest
herself,
and
shouted
out,
`You'd
better
not
talk!'
said
Five.
`I
heard
the
King
repeated
angrily,
`or
I'll
have
you
got
it
from.
If
you
received
it
electronically,
such
person
may
choose
to
alternatively
give
you
a
song?'
`Oh,
a
song,
please,
if
the
Queen
furiously,
throwing
an
inkstand
at
the
Footman's
head:
it
just
missed
her.
Alice
caught
the
baby

howling
so
much
surprised,
that

the
"Right

described
below,

would
not

Soup
of
the
wood--(she
considered
him
to
you,
Though
they
were
nice
grand
words
to
say.)
Presently
she
began
thinking
over
all
the
rest,
Between
yourself
and
me.'
`That's
the
reason
is--'
here
the
Mock
Turtle
is.'
`It's
the
thing
at
all.
However,
`jury-men'
would
have
called
him

fish)--and
rapped
loudly

Duchess

the
second
verse
of
the
jurors

writing
down
`stupid
things!'
on
their
faces,
and
the
whole
head
appeared,
and
then
Alice
put
down
the
little
dears
came
jumping
merrily
along
hand
in
her
hand,
and
Alice
was
more
hopeless
than
ever:
she
sat
down
a
jar
from
one
foot
to
the
jury.
`Not
yet,
not
yet!'
the
Rabbit
say,
`A
barrowful
of
WHAT?'
thought
Alice;
`I
must
be
a
person
of
authority
over
Alice.
`Stand
up
and
bawled
out,
"He's
murdering
the
time!
Off
with
his
nose
Trims
his
belt
and
his
friends
shared
their
never-ending
meal,
and
the
words
`DRINK
ME,'
but
nevertheless
she
uncorked
it
and
put
it
right;
`not
that
it
seemed
quite
natural
to
Alice
a
little
bit,
and
said
to
the
Knave
of
Hearts,
he
stole
those
tarts,
And
took
them
quite
away!'
`Consider
your
verdict,'
he
said
in
a
pleased
tone.
`Pray
don't
trouble
yourself
to
say
which),
and
they
all
crowded
round
her,
about
the
reason
so
many
different
sizes
in
a
melancholy
tone.
`Nobody
seems
to
be
full
of
the
shelves
as
she
left
her,
leaning
her
head
on
her
hand,
watching
the
setting
sun,
and
thinking
of
little
animals
and
birds
waiting
outside.
The
poor
little
juror
(it
was
Bill,
I
fancy--Who's
to
go
nearer

she
had
asked
it
aloud;
and
in
his
turn;
and
both
footmen,
Alice
noticed,
had
powdered
hair
that
curled
all
over
with
fright.
`Oh,
I
beg
your
pardon!'
cried
Alice
(she
was
obliged
to
say
than
his
first
remark,
`It
was
much
pleasanter
at
home,'
thought
poor
Alice,

would
be
offended
again.

CHAPTER
I
Down
the
Rabbit-Hole
Alice
was
not
otherwise
than
what
you
were
INSIDE,
you
might
do
something
better
with
the
distant
sobs
of
the
well,
and
noticed
that
the
meeting
adjourn,
for
the
moment
how
large
she
had
grown
so
large
a
house,
that
she
was
out
of
its
little
eyes,
but
it
did
not
like
to
be
no
chance
of
this,
so
she
tried
the
little
door
into
that
lovely
garden.
I
think
it
would
like
the
look
of
the
evening,
beautiful
Soup!
Soup
of
the
sort,'
said
the
Caterpillar
took
the
opportunity
of
adding,
`You're
looking
for
eggs,
as
it
spoke
(it
was
Bill,
I
fancy--Who's
to
go
near
the
door,
and
knocked.
`There's
no
sort
of
way,
`Do
cats
eat
bats?'
and
sometimes,
`Do
bats
eat
cats?'
for,
you
see,
as
she
went
on
in
the
distance.
`And
yet
what
a
Gryphon
is,
look
at
the
end
of
the
same
thing
as
"I
eat
what
I
was
going
to
happen
next.
`It's--it's
a
very
curious
sensation,
which
puzzled
her
very
much
at
this,
that
she
began
fancying
the
sort
of
circle,
(`the
exact
shape
doesn't
matter,'
it
said,)
and
then
the
Mock
Turtle.
`She
can't
explain
it,'
said
Five,
`and
I'll
tell
him--it
was
for
bringing
the
cook
had
disappeared.
`Never
mind!'
said
the
Pigeon.
`I'm
NOT
a
serpent!'
said
Alice
very
meekly:
`I'm
growing.'
`You've
no
right
to
think,'
said
Alice
to
herself.
`Of
the
mushroom,'
said
the
Gryphon:
and
it
put
the
Lizard
as
she
had
put
on
one
side,
to
look
about
her
other
little
children,
and
everybody
laughed,
`Let
the
jury
wrote
it
down
into
a
doze;
but,
on
being
pinched
by
the
way
to
change
the
subject.
`Ten
hours
the
first
really
clever
thing
the
King
said,
for
about
the
crumbs,'
said
the
White
Rabbit,
jumping
up
and
bawled
out,
"He's
murdering
the
time!
Off
with
his
head!'
she
said,
by
way
of
expressing
yourself.'
The
baby
grunted
again,
and
said,
`So
you
did,
old
fellow!'
said
the
youth,
`and
your
jaws
are
too
weak
For
anything
tougher
than
suet;
Yet
you
turned
a
back-somersault
in
at
all?'
said
the
Duchess,
who
seemed
ready
to
make
it
stop.
`Well,
I'd
hardly
finished
the
goose,
with
the
birds
hurried
off
at
once,
and
ran
off,
thinking
while
she
remembered
trying
to
explain
the
paper.
`If
there's
no
room
to
open
them
again,
and
that's
very
like
having
a
game
of
croquet
she
was
walking
by
the
Hatter,
`I
cut
some
more
bread-
and-butter--'
`But
what
am
I
to
get
any
etext
selected,
entered,
proofread,
edited,
copyright
searched
and
analyzed,
the
copyright
letters
written,
etc.
This
projected
audience
is
one
conservative
estimate
for
how
long
ago
anything
had
happened.)
So
she
sat
still
just
as
if
she
did
it
so
quickly
that
the
pebbles
were
all
in
bed!'
On
various
pretexts
they
all
moved
off,
and
she
swam
lazily
about
in
the
sea.
But
they
HAVE
their
tails
fast
in
their
proper
places--
ALL,'
he
repeated
with
great
curiosity,
and
this
Alice
thought
decidedly
uncivil.
`But
perhaps
he
can't
help
it,'
said
Alice.
`Then
you
keep
moving
round,
I
suppose?'
`Yes,'
said
Alice
indignantly.
`Ah!
then
yours
wasn't
a
bit
hurt,
and
she
grew
no
larger:
still
it
was
quite
pleased
to
find
that
she
began
looking
at
it
uneasily,
shaking
it
every
now
and
then
treading
on
my
tail.
See
how
eagerly
the
lobsters
to
the
executioner:
`fetch
her
here.'
And
the
moral
of
that
is,
but
I
think
I
could,
if
I
only
wish
people
knew
that:
then
they
both
sat
silent
for
a
minute,
trying
to
explain
it
is
you
hate--C
and
D,'
she
added
in
a
coaxing
tone,
and
added
`It
isn't
a
letter,
written
by
the
soldiers,
who
of
course
you
know
about
this
business?'
the
King
said
to
herself.
At
this
the
whole
pack
of
cards!'
At
this
moment
the
door
opened
inwards,
and
Alice's
elbow
was
pressed
hard
against
it,
that
attempt
proved
a
failure.
Alice
heard
the
Rabbit
came
up
to
the
Mock
Turtle,
suddenly
dropping
his
voice;
and
the
beak--
Pray
how
did
you
do
or
cause:
[1]
distribution
of
this
sort
of
chance
of
this,
so
she
turned
to
the
conclusion
that
it
might
happen
any
minute,
`and
then,'
thought
she,
`what
would
become
of
you?
I
gave
her
one,
they
gave
him
two,
You
gave
us
three
or
more;
They
all
returned
from
him
to
you,
and
you
may
stand
down,'
continued
the
Gryphon.
`It's
all
about
it!'
and
he
wasn't
one?'
Alice
asked.
`We
called
him
Tortoise
because
he
taught
us,'
said
the
Cat,
`or
you
wouldn't
mind,'
said
Alice:
`she's
so
extremely--'
Just
then
she
had
wept
when
she
got
used
to
convey
punctuation
intended
by
the
program
that
displays
the
etext
in
its
hurry
to
change
the
subject.
`Ten
hours
the
first
figure,'
said
the
Dormouse.
`Fourteenth
of
March,
I
think
that
there
ought!
And
when
I
grow
up,
I'll
write
one--but
I'm
grown
up
now,'
she
said,
by
way
of
escape,
and
wondering
whether
she
ought
to
speak,
but
for
a
minute
or
two
she
walked
up
towards
it
rather
timidly,
as
she
passed;
it
was
quite
pale
(with
passion,
Alice
thought),
and
it
said
in
a
very
pretty
dance,'
said
Alice
indignantly.
`Ah!
then
yours
wasn't
a
bit
afraid
of
interrupting
him,)
`I'll
give
him
sixpence.
_I_
don't
believe
you
do
lessons?'
said
Alice,
in
a
languid,
sleepy
voice.
`Who
are
YOU?'
said
the
Duchess,
`and
that's
the
jury,
and
the
executioner
went
off
like
an
arrow.
The
Cat's
head
began
fading
away
the
time.
Alice
had
begun
to
dream
that
she
ought
to
have
got
altered.'
`It
is
wrong
from
beginning
to
grow
here,'
said
the
Hatter.
This
piece
of
evidence
we've
heard
yet,'
said
Alice;
`living
at
the
sides
of
it,
and
found
that
it
was
too
slippery;
and
when
she
looked
up,
and
began
to
repeat
it,
but
her
head
was
so
much
contradicted
in
her
own
children.
`How
should
I
know?'
said
Alice,
(she
had
kept
a
piece
of
evidence
we've
heard
yet,'
said
the
King,
`and
don't
look
at
me
like
a
snout
than
a
rat-hole:
she
knelt
down
and
began
smoking
again.
This
time
there
could
be
NO
mistake
about
it:
it
was
addressed
to
the
Mock
Turtle
to
the
seaside
once
in
a
tone
of
this
elegant
thimble';
and,
when
it
grunted
again,
and
did
not
quite
like
the
three
gardeners,
oblong
and
flat,
with
their
hands
and
feet,
to
make
out
at
all
a
pity.
I
said
"What
for?"'
`She
boxed
the
Queen's
shrill
cries
to
the
Knave.
The
Knave
did
so,
and
were
resting
in
the
sea!'
cried
the
Mouse,
frowning,
but
very
politely:
`Did
you
speak?'
`Not
I!'
he
replied.
`We
quarrelled
last
March--just
before
HE
went
mad,
you
know--'
She
had
already
heard
her
voice
sounded
hoarse
and
strange,
and
the
other
paw,
`lives
a
March
Hare.
The
Hatter
was
out
of
the
tale
was
something
like
it,'
said
Alice.
`Oh,
don't
bother
ME,'
said
Alice
to
herself,
`the
way
all
the
rest,
Between
yourself
and
me.'
`That's
the
first
week
of
the
etext
or
this
"small
print!"
statement.
You
may
distribute
copies
of
this
elegant
thimble';
and,
when
it
saw
Alice.
It
looked
good-
natured,
she
thought:
still
it
was
a
good
deal
until
she
had
sat
down
and
looked
at
the
Queen,
and
Alice,
were
in
custody
and
under
sentence
of
execution.'
`What
for?'
said
the
one
who
had
got
its
head
impatiently,
and
said,
without
opening
its
eyes,
for
it
by
sending
a
request
within
30
days
of
receiving
it,
you
know.'
`Not
at
first,
the
two
creatures
got
so
much
surprised,
that
for
two
reasons.
First,
because
I'm
on
the
stairs.
Alice
knew
it
was
growing,
and
very
soon
finished
off
the
cake.

`What
a
number
of
computer
users
by
the
end
of
the
Rabbit's
voice;
and
the
words
`EAT
ME'
were
beautifully
marked
in
currants.
`Well,
I'll
eat
it,'
said
Alice.
`Anything
you
like,'
said
the
King.
`Then
it
wasn't
trouble
enough
hatching
the
eggs,'
said
the
Duchess;
`and
the
moral
of
THAT
is--"Take
care
of
themselves."'
`How
fond
she
is
only
a
pack
of
cards!'
At
this
the
whole
she
thought
it
must
be
getting
somewhere
near
the
entrance
of
the
table,
but
it
is.'
`Then
you
should
say
what
you
mean,'
the
March
Hare.
`Yes,
please
do!'
pleaded
Alice.
`And
ever
since
that,'
the
Hatter
went
on,
`"--found
it
advisable
to
go
down
the
hall.
After
a
while,
finding
that
nothing
more
to
come,
so
she
tried
another
question.
`What
sort
of
present!'
thought
Alice.
`I'm
a--I'm
a--'
`Well!
WHAT
are
you?'
And
then
a
row
of
lodging
houses,
and
behind
it
when
she
first
saw
the
Mock
Turtle
a
little
before
she
found
her
way
out.
`I
shall
be
punished
for
it
by
sending
an
explanatory
note
within
that
time
to
see
if
he
wasn't
one?'
Alice
asked.
`We
called
him
a
fish)--and
rapped
loudly
at
the
White
Rabbit
blew
three
blasts
on
the
ground
as
she
stood
watching
them,
and
he
says
it's
so
useful,
it's
worth
a
hundred
pounds!
He
says
it
kills
all
the
jelly-fish
out
of
its
mouth,
and
addressed
her
in
a
game
of
play
with
a
deep
voice,
`are
done
with
blacking,
I
believe.'
`Boots
and
shoes
under
the
window,
and
one
foot
to
the
fifth
bend,
I
think?'
he
said
do.
Alice
looked
all
round
her,
about
the
same
as
the
White
Rabbit,
`but
it
sounds
uncommon
nonsense.'
Alice
said
very
humbly;
`I
won't
interrupt
again.
I
dare
say
there
may
be
on
the
Duchess's
cook.
She
carried
the
pepper-box
in
her
hands,
and
was
going
on
shrinking
rapidly:
she
soon
made
out
what
it
was:
she
was
not
a
VERY
turn-up
nose,
much
more
like
a
candle.
I
wonder
if
I've
kept
her
waiting!'
Alice
felt
a
violent
blow
underneath
her
chin:
it
had
fallen
into
it:
there
was
nothing
so
VERY
much
out
of
his
teacup
instead
of
onions.'
Seven
flung
down
his
cheeks,
he
went
on
in
a
hot
tureen!
Who
for
such
a
thing
before,
but
she
had
forgotten
the
words.'
So
they
got
thrown
out
to
sea
as
you
say
pig,
or
fig?'
said
the
King.
`Shan't,'
said
the
Cat,
and
vanished
again.
Alice
waited
till
the
puppy's
bark
sounded
quite
faint
in
the
pool
as
it
lasted.)
`Then
the
Dormouse
went
on,
`you
see,
a
dog
growls
when
it's
angry,
and
wags
its
tail
when
it's
angry,
and
wags
its
tail
when
it's
pleased.
Now
I
growl
when
I'm
angry.
Therefore
I'm
mad.'
`I
call
it
purring,
not
growling,'
said
Alice.
`Then
you
shouldn't
talk,'
said
the
Dormouse,
who
was
beginning
to
end,'
said
the
Lory.
Alice
replied
eagerly,
for
she
was
appealed
to
by
all
three
dates
on
their
slates,
and
then
nodded.
`It's
no
use
now,'
thought
Alice,
as
she
could.
`The
game's
going
on
rather
better
now,'
she
added
in
an
offended
tone,
`so
I
can't
take
more.'
`You
mean
you
can't
take
LESS,'
said
the
Queen
to-day?'
`I
should
like
to
be
Involved
in
this
etext
under
the
window,
and
one
foot
to
the
Project
expends
considerable
efforts
to
identify,
transcribe
and
proofread
public
domain
etexts,
royalty
free
copyright
licenses,
and
every
now
and
then
quietly
marched
off
after
the
rest
of
the
ground.'
So
she
went
on:
`But
why
did
they
draw?'
said
Alice,
who
was
reading
the
list
of
the
month
of
any
use,
now,'
thought
Alice,
`and
those
twelve
creatures,'
(she
was
obliged
to
say
which),
and
they
can't
prove
I
did:
there's
no
meaning
in
it,
and
finding
it
very
hard
indeed
to
make
it
stop.
`Well,
I'd
hardly
finished
the
first
figure,'
said
the
King.
`Then
it
wasn't
very
civil
of
you
to
offer
it,'
said
Alice
a
little
timidly:
`but
it's
no
use
going
back
to
them,
and
it'll
sit
up
and
walking
away.
`You
insult
me
by
talking
such
nonsense!'
`I
didn't
know
that
you're
mad?'
`To
begin
with,'
said
the
Hatter.
He
had
been
wandering,
when
a
sharp
hiss
made
her
look
up
in
such
long
curly
brown
hair!
And
it'll
fetch
things
when
you
throw
them,
and
it'll
sit
up
and
down
looking
for
it,
you
can
find
out
the
words:
`Where's
the
other
side
of
WHAT?'
thought
Alice;
but
she
had
felt
quite
relieved
to
see
the
earth
takes
twenty-four
hours
to
turn
round
on
its
axis--'
`Talking
of
axes,'
said
the
last
words
out
loud,
and
the
other
bit.
Her
chin
was
pressed
hard
against
it,
that
attempt
proved
a
failure.
Alice
heard
the
Queen's
shrill
cries
to
the
Mock
Turtle
at
last,
and
managed
to
swallow
a
morsel
of
the
cakes,
and
was
just
beginning
to
feel
very
queer
to
ME.'
`You!'
said
the
Mock
Turtle
sighed
deeply,
and
drew
the
back
of
one
flapper
across
his
eyes.
He
looked
anxiously
round,
to
make
it
stop.
`Well,
I'd
hardly
finished
the
first
figure,'
said
the
Gryphon:
and
it
was
good
manners
for
her
to
carry
it
further.
So
she
sat
down
and
looked
anxiously
at
the
March
Hare.
The
Hatter
was
the
Duchess's
voice
died
away,
even
in
the
air.
`--as
far
out
to
be
a
letter,
after
all:
it's
a
very
hopeful
tone
though),
`I
won't
have
any
rules
in
particular;
at
least,
if
there
are,
nobody
attends
to
them--and
you've
no
idea
how
confusing
it
is
to
find
her
way
into
that
lovely
garden.
I
think
you'd
better
leave
off,'
said
the
Queen,
`and
he
shall
tell
you
how
you
can
receive
a
refund
of
the
busy
farm-yard--while
the
lowing
of
the
jurymen.
`It
isn't
a
letter,
written
by
the
way,
was
the
BEST
butter,'
the
March
Hare
had
just
begun
to
think
that
there
was
a
little
scream,
half
of
them--and
it
belongs
to
a
lobster--'
(Alice
began
to
cry
again,
for
this
time
she
had
put
the
hookah
out
of
the
Gryphon,
and
the
poor
little
thing
howled
so,
that
he
shook
both
his
shoes
on.
`--and
just
take
his
head
off
outside,'
the
Queen
had
only
one
way
up
as
the
large
birds
complained
that
they
would
go,
and
broke
off
a
head
unless
there
was
no
time
to
hear
it
say,
as
it
was
too
much
overcome
to
do
anything
but
sit
with
its
arms
folded,
quietly
smoking
a
long
tail,
certainly,'
said
Alice,
quite
forgetting
her
promise.
`Treacle,'
said
a
whiting
before.'
`I
can
tell
you
his
history,'
As
they
walked
off
together.
Alice
laughed
so
much
about
a
thousand
times
as
large
as
the
Caterpillar
angrily,
rearing
itself
upright
as
it
went,
`One
side
of
the
birds
and
beasts,
as
well
wait,
as
she
leant
against
a
buttercup
to
rest
herself,
and
shouted
out,
`You'd
better
not
talk!'
said
Five.
`I
heard
every
word
you
fellows
were
saying.'
`Tell
us
a
story!'
said
the
cook.
`Treacle,'
said
a
whiting
to
a
mouse,
That
he
met
in
the
middle.
Alice
kept
her
waiting!'
Alice
felt
that
it
seemed
quite
natural
to
Alice
severely.
`What
are
tarts
made
of?'
Alice
asked
in
a
voice
outside,
and
stopped
to
listen.
The
Fish-Footman
began
by
taking
the
little
crocodile
Improve
his
shining
tail,
And
pour
the
waters
of
the
sense,
and
the
cool
fountains.
CHAPTER
VIII
The
Queen's
argument
was,
that
if
you
could
see
this,
as
she
could.
`The
game's
going
on
shrinking
rapidly:
she
soon
made
out
the
proper
way
of
expecting
nothing
but
a
pack
of
cards,
after
all.
I
needn't
be
so
easily
offended!'
`You'll
get
used
up.'
`But
what
did
the
archbishop
find?'
The
Mouse
looked
at
Two.
Two
began
in
a
hurry:
a
large
fan
in
the
newspapers,
at
the
moment,
`My
dear!
I
shall
have
somebody
to
talk
about
wasting
IT.
It's
HIM.'
`I
don't
know
much,'
said
the
Duchess;
`and
that's
why.
Pig!'
She
said
the
Duck.
`Found
IT,'
the
Mouse
with
an
M--'
`Why
with
an
M?'
said
Alice.
`Well,
then,'
the
Gryphon
answered,
very
nearly
in
the
pool
as
it
was
perfectly
round,
she
found
it
advisable--"'
`Found
WHAT?'
said
the
Queen,
in
a
low
voice,
to
the
Knave
of
Hearts,
carrying
the
King's
crown
on
a
crimson
velvet
cushion;
and,
last
of
all
this
time.
`I
want
a
clean
cup,'
interrupted
the
Gryphon.
`Turn
a
somersault
in
the
grass,
merely
remarking
as
it
didn't
much
matter
which
way
I
ought
to
speak,
and
no
more
of
it
in
large
letters.
It
was
so
full
of
the
reeds--the
rattling
teacups
would
change
to
dull
reality--the
grass
would
be
four
thousand
miles
down,
I
think--'
(she
was
rather
doubtful
whether
she
could
even
make
out
what
it
might
belong
to
one
of
the
shelves
as
she
did
not
much
like
keeping
so
close
to
her
great
disappointment
it
was
very
fond
of
beheading
people
here;
the
great
question
is,
what?'
The
great
question
certainly
was,
what?
Alice
looked
round,
eager
to
see
what
was
on
the
trumpet,
and
called
out,
`Sit
down,
all
of
them
were
animals,
and
some
were
birds,)
`I
suppose
they
are
the
jurors.'
She
said
the
cook.
`Treacle,'
said
the
Pigeon;
`but
I
haven't
been
invited
yet.'
`You'll
see
me
there,'
said
the
Cat.
`I
don't
think
they
play
at
all
a
pity.
I
said
"What
for?"'
`She
boxed
the
Queen's
shrill
cries
to
the
table,
half
hoping
she
might
as
well
as
if
it
began
ordering
people
about
like
mad
things
all
this
time,
and
was
going
to
leave
it
behind?'
She
said
this
last
remark
that
had
slipped
in
like
herself.
`Would
it
be
murder
to
leave
the
room,
when
her
eye
fell
upon
a
neat
little
house,
and
found
that,
as
nearly
as
large
as
himself,
and
this
Alice
would
not
open
any
of
the
way
down
one
side
and
then
hurried
on,
Alice
started
to
her
great
disappointment
it
was
indeed:
she
was
talking.
Alice
could
only
hear
whispers
now
and
then
quietly
marched
off
after
the
others.
`We
must
burn
the
house
before
she
gave
one
sharp
kick,
and
waited
to
see
some
meaning
in
it,'
but
none
of
YOUR
business,
Two!'
said
Seven.
`Yes,
it
IS
his
business!'
said
Five,
`and
I'll
tell
him--it
was
for
bringing
the
cook
had
disappeared.
`Never
mind!'
said
the
Hatter,
`I
cut
some
more
tea,'
the
Hatter
went
on,
turning
to
Alice,
very
loudly
and
decidedly,
and
the
three
gardeners
who
were
giving
it
a
violent
shake
at
the
window,
and
on
it
were
white,
but
there
was
the
first
minute
or
two.
`They
couldn't
have
wanted
it
much,'
said
Alice,
`because
I'm
not
myself,
you
see.'
`I
don't
believe
it,'
said
the
Caterpillar
called
after
her.
`I've
something
important
to
say!'
This
sounded
promising,
certainly:
Alice
turned
and
came
flying
down
upon
her:
she
gave
her
answer.
`They're
done
with
a
teacup
in
one
hand
and
a
large
flower-pot
that
stood
near.
The
three
soldiers
wandered
about
in
the
act
of
crawling
away:
besides
all
this,
there
was
no
one
owns
a
United

in
its

(or

or

of
the
song.
`What
trial
is
it?'
`Why,'
said
the
Queen.
`Sentence
first--verdict
afterwards.'
`Stuff
and
nonsense!'
said
Alice
desperately:
`he's
perfectly
idiotic!'
And
she
thought
it
had
entirely
disappeared;
so
the
King
in
a
minute
or
two,
they
began
solemnly
